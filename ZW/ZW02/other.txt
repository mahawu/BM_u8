ZW02n0000_p0001a05_##<p,0,2>大藏經是中國佛教世代精華的積累，是中國人貢獻給世界的
ZW02n0000_p0001a06_##一份文化瑰寶。南北朝以來，歷朝歷代都要編修大藏經，這已經與
ZW02n0000_p0001a07_##歷朝歷代都要修正史併列，成為我國歷史上的兩大人文景觀。近
ZW02n0000_p0001a08_##代以來，隨著人們對佛教認識的深化，新的編纂大藏經的熱潮也隨
ZW02n0000_p0001a09_##之興起。當前，隨著電子化書籍的急劇發展，海內外編纂光電版大
ZW02n0000_p0001a10_##藏經的呼聲也日益高漲。在這種形勢下，今年4月9日至10日，
ZW02n0000_p0001a11_##國務院宗教事務局主持召開了「大藏經編纂及其電腦化學術研討
ZW02n0000_p0001a12_##會」（簡稱「大藏經工程研討會」），在京的學術界、宗教界近40名專
ZW02n0000_p0001a13_##家、大德參加會議。與會人士暢所欲言，從各個角度對編纂一部代
ZW02n0000_p0001a14_##表中華民族最高水平大藏經的重要性、必要性與可行性作了充分
ZW02n0000_p0001a15_##的論證。這是一次重要的會議，標誌著我國的大藏經編纂事業即
ZW02n0000_p0001a16_##將進入一個新的時期。值得一提的是，四月上旬，在臺灣佛光山也
ZW02n0000_p0001a17_##召開了同一主題的國際學術研討會，這充分證明海峽兩岸及國際
ZW02n0000_p0001a18_##社會對這一偉大事業的關注之情。為編纂大藏經服務，本來就是
ZW02n0000_p0001a19_##我們《藏外佛教文獻》的基本宗旨與奮鬥目標，所以，我們熱烈祝賀
ZW02n0000_p0001a20_##這次會議的成功召開。經主辦單位同意，我們特意選取11篇會議
ZW02n0000_p0001a21_##論文，並把會議的其他發言以及未收入本書的論文整理為「發言摘
ZW02n0000_p0001a22_##要」，在第二輯上作為特集發表，以期引起社會各界對這件大事的
ZW02n0000_p0001a23_##關注與進一步的討論。按照《藏外佛教文獻》的體例，關於佛教文
ZW02n0000_p0001a24_##獻學的研究論文一般都排列在佛教文獻之後，但[象>像]「大藏經工程研
ZW02n0000_p0001a25_##討會」這樣的大事，顯然應該引起人們更加廣泛的關心與支持，所
ZW02n0000_p0001a26_##以我們把這一組論文放在本輯之首。盛世修藏，澤被千秋。我們
ZW02n0000_p0001a27_##希望海內外中國人攜起手來，漢傳佛教文化圈各國攜起手來，佛教
ZW02n0000_p0002a01_##界、學術界攜起手來，為編纂一部總結當代，開創未來的大藏經而
ZW02n0000_p0002a02_##奮鬥。
ZW02n0000_p0002a03_##<p,0,2>《藏外佛教文獻》第二輯發表的其它文獻內容如下：
ZW02n0000_p0002a04_##<p,0,2>「敦煌禪籍」專欄刊登兩篇敦煌禪文獻。
ZW02n0000_p0002a05_##<p,0,2>《七祖法寶記》是一篇較為奇特的禪宗文獻，通篇為引摘經文
ZW02n0000_p0002a06_##而成，相當於《諸經要集》。以前，人們都說中國的禪宗「不依經論，
ZW02n0000_p0002a07_##不立文字」，但《七祖法寶記》不但既立文字，又依經文，而且表現出
ZW02n0000_p0002a08_##處處依據經文，證成己說的姿態。該文獻以往未見著錄，新近在北
ZW02n0000_p0002a09_##京圖書館發現。其中一號是敦煌運京後始終存於北圖，但未能鑒
ZW02n0000_p0002a10_##別公佈的；另一號則是曾經流散在外，後收歸北圖的。兩號原為同
ZW02n0000_p0002a11_##卷，可惜中間尚有殘缺，不能直接綴接。尾題作「下卷」，則原著應
ZW02n0000_p0002a12_##為兩或三卷。該七祖是誰，尚難斷定。從本文的思想傾向看，似應
ZW02n0000_p0002a13_##屬禪宗北宗系。
ZW02n0000_p0002a14_##<p,0,2>《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》已經在第一輯整理發表。如第一輯
ZW02n0000_p0002a15_##該文題解所說，佛典在傳抄中增衍嬗變，事屬常見。如果在流傳中
ZW02n0000_p0002a16_##形成異本，則應分別整理成文。但對某些典籍來說，是否應視為異
ZW02n0000_p0002a17_##本，情況比較複雜。故此我們繼在第一輯中將該文獻合併整理為
ZW02n0000_p0002a18_##一篇後，又在第二輯中將該文獻分別整理為兩篇，作為對整理此類
ZW02n0000_p0002a19_##文獻的一個新的嘗試。敬請批評。
ZW02n0000_p0002a20_##<p,0,2>「三藏論疏」專欄本輯亦刊登兩篇文獻。
ZW02n0000_p0002a21_##<p,0,2>《淨名經集解關中疏》，唐道液集，是現存關於《維摩詰所說經》
ZW02n0000_p0002a22_##的註疏中較為重要的一種。該疏在敦煌遺書中保存多號，早為研
ZW02n0000_p0002a23_##究者注意，並被錄文收入《大正藏》第85卷。遺憾的是《大正藏》所
ZW02n0000_p0002a24_##收該疏缺乏精審的校勘，並從第五品後半部分到第七品前半部分，
ZW02n0000_p0002a25_##脫漏一萬多字。故本書發表的整理本實為該疏全本的初次發表。
ZW02n0000_p0002a26_##該疏分上下兩卷，文字量較大。第二輯限於篇幅，僅刊出卷上。卷
ZW02n0000_p0002a27_##下將發表在第三輯中。
ZW02n0000_p0002a28_##<p,0,2>《法華經文外義》，是對《法華經》的註疏，亦係從敦煌遺書中整
ZW02n0000_p0003a01_##理出來，作者不詳，歷代經錄未見著錄。原卷現保存在上海博物
ZW02n0000_p0003a02_##館。如標題所示，本文並不注重於疏通《法華經》的文句，而是從
ZW02n0000_p0003a03_##《法華經》抽出若干個問題，進行專門的論述。從該文可以窺見當
ZW02n0000_p0003a04_##時對《法華經》研習的主要問題及理論傾向。該寫卷抄寫於西魏大
ZW02n0000_p0003a05_##統十一年（545），保留了相當數量的南北朝時期的古體字，遣詞造
ZW02n0000_p0003a06_##句頗帶口語色彩，對研究南北朝時期的語言、文字均有一定的價
ZW02n0000_p0003a07_##值。
ZW02n0000_p0003a08_##<p,0,2>「天竺要典」專欄刊登印度耆那教的主要典籍《諦義證得經》。
ZW02n0000_p0003a09_##<p,0,2>耆那教即佛典中所謂的「尼乾外道」，至今仍然是印度有著重
ZW02n0000_p0003a10_##要影響的宗教派別之一。耆那教與佛教產生在同一時代、同一地
ZW02n0000_p0003a11_##區，有著大致相同的社會信徒層面，因此，兩者的教義有許多相同
ZW02n0000_p0003a12_##或相近的地方。研究佛教，特別是研究初期佛教，必須研究耆那
ZW02n0000_p0003a13_##教，這已經成為世界佛教研究界的共識。遺憾的是除了佛典中的
ZW02n0000_p0003a14_##介紹之外，兩千年來，我國從來沒有翻譯介紹過耆那教的經典。而
ZW02n0000_p0003a15_##《諦義證得經》是耆那教諸多經典中唯一被白衣、空衣兩大派共同
ZW02n0000_p0003a16_##尊奉的典籍，也是公認的論述耆那教教義最為精要的典籍，故此譯
ZW02n0000_p0003a17_##出。中國佛教有將印度外道典籍編入大藏經的傳統，如陳真諦翻
ZW02n0000_p0003a18_##譯的古印度數論派著作《金七十論》、唐玄奘翻譯的古印度勝論派
ZW02n0000_p0003a19_##著作《勝宗十句義論》等。遵循這一傳統，我們把這部《諦義證得
ZW02n0000_p0003a20_##經》編入《藏外佛教文獻》，以饗讀者。
ZW02n0000_p0003a21_##<p,0,2>「遺珠集粹」專欄刊登近代著名佛教學者韓清淨先生晚年重要
ZW02n0000_p0003a22_##論文《瑜伽師地論披尋記敘》。
ZW02n0000_p0003a23_##<p,0,2>韓清淨先生在這篇論文中追述了自己一生學業發展的經歷，
ZW02n0000_p0003a24_##闡明了《瑜伽師地論》對「弘揚真實佛教精義」的意義，所以該文是
ZW02n0000_p0003a25_##研究韓清淨先生思想的重要資料。論文還指出《瑜伽師地論》的梵
ZW02n0000_p0003a26_##文原本存在著多處錯簡，發千年之覆，值得重視。這篇重要論文在
ZW02n0000_p0003a27_##歷盡劫波之後，得以首次發表，實在令人歡喜讚歎。

ZW02n0000_p0004a01_##
ZW02n0000_p0004a02Q1#[POREWORD>FOREWORD]
ZW02n0000_p0004a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0004a04_##<p,0,2>Ever since the beginning of the modern times, a fresh upsurge
ZW02n0000_p0004a05_## in compiling the Dazangjing (or Tats'angching) has been ushered in
ZW02n0000_p0004a06_## with the deepening of people's knowledge of Buddhism. And while
ZW02n0000_p0004a07_## the electronic publication is [develping>developing] rapidly nowadays, the appeal
ZW02n0000_p0004a08_## for editing [aphotoelectric>a photoelectric] edition of the Dazangjing, at home and
ZW02n0000_p0004a09_## abroad, has become more and more powerful. Under such circumstances,
ZW02n0000_p0004a10_## the Bureau of Religious Affairs of the State Council presided
ZW02n0000_p0004a11_## over a "Symposium on the Compilation of the Dazangjing and Its
ZW02n0000_p0004a12_## [Compu terization>Computerization]" ("Symposium on the Dazangjing Project") in Beijing
ZW02n0000_p0004a13_## from April 9 to 10, 1996. Present at the conference were nearly
ZW02n0000_p0004a14_## 40 [emi nent>eminent] experts and monks from both the academic and religious
ZW02n0000_p0004a15_## circles in Beijing. The participants spoke out freely and, from various
ZW02n0000_p0004a16_## angles, proved up to the hilt the importance, necessity and feasibility
ZW02n0000_p0004a17_## of compiling a new Dazangjing which would be able to embody
ZW02n0000_p0004a18_## the supreme learning level of the Chinese nation. The convening of
ZW02n0000_p0004a19_## this important meeting marked the beginning of a new historical period
ZW02n0000_p0004a20_## in the undertakings of compiling the Dazangjing. And since to
ZW02n0000_p0004a21_## serve the compilation of the Dazangjing is the fundamental aim of
ZW02n0000_p0004a22_## our <it>Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</it>, we editors
ZW02n0000_p0004a23_## here would like to warmly congratulate the participants on the successful
ZW02n0000_p0004a24_## convention of this symposium. With the agreement of the
ZW02n0000_p0004a25_## sponsor of the symposium, we have here selected 11 papers by the
ZW02n0000_p0004a26_## participants and edited the remainder speeches and papers given at
ZW02n0000_p0004a27_## the symposium as "Excerpts of Speeches." By arranging all this as a
ZW02n0000_p0004a28_## special issue in the second number of our book, we expect that personages
ZW02n0000_p0005a01_## of various social circles could pay close attention to this event
ZW02n0000_p0005a02_## and join the discussion. According to the layout of our <it>Buddhist
ZW02n0000_p0005a03_## Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</it>, research papers, as a rule,
ZW02n0000_p0005a04_## are arranged behind the Buddhist literature itself. However, it is
ZW02n0000_p0005a05_## clear that such an event as the Symposium on the Dazangjing Project
ZW02n0000_p0005a06_## should draw wider attention and support from people; there fore, we
ZW02n0000_p0005a07_## put this group of papers at the beginning of this number of our
ZW02n0000_p0005a08_## book. It is worth mentioning that an international academic symposium
ZW02n0000_p0005a09_## on the same topic was also convened at the Foguangshan Hill in
ZW02n0000_p0005a10_## Taiwan in the first [tenday>ten-day] period of last April. All this proves fully
ZW02n0000_p0005a11_## that the international community as well as both sides of the Taiwan
ZW02n0000_p0005a12_## Straits are very concerned with this great cause.
ZW02n0000_p0005a13_##<p,0,2>The main contents of the second number of <it>the Buddhist Texts
ZW02n0000_p0005a14_## Not Contained in the Tripitaka</it> are as follows:
ZW02n0000_p0005a15_##<p,0,2>The column "Chan Texts from Dunhuang" of this number publish
ZW02n0000_p0005a16_## two Chan texts from Dunhuang, viz. <it>the Qizu Fabao Ji</it> and the
ZW02n0000_p0005a17_## <it>Tianzhuguo Putidamo Chanshi Lun.</it>
ZW02n0000_p0005a18_##<p,0,2><it>The Qizu Fabao Ji</it> is such a peculiar Chan text that the whole
ZW02n0000_p0005a19_## of it is composed of quotations and citations, and is therefore equal
ZW02n0000_p0005a20_## to the <it>Zhu Jing Yao Ji.</it> Previously, people all said that China's
ZW02n0000_p0005a21_## Chan School "has not followed any sutra or abhidharma, and has no
ZW02n0000_p0005a22_## written works." Nevertheless, <it>the Qizu Fabao Ji</it> is not [noly>only] a
ZW02n0000_p0005a23_## written work, but also has followed some sutras and abhidharmas.
ZW02n0000_p0005a24_## As a matter of fact, the author put forth and proved his own doctrine
ZW02n0000_p0005a25_## upon the basis of some scriptures throughout the text. It was
ZW02n0000_p0005a26_## never recorded before and has been discovered in the Beijing [Lib rary>Library]
ZW02n0000_p0005a27_## of late. NO.1 of the two parts of the text has been preserved in the
ZW02n0000_p0005a28_## Beijing Library since it was brought to the city from Dun huang,
ZW02n0000_p0006a01_## and has failed to be appraised and published; another number of the
ZW02n0000_p0006a02_## text had once drifted outside and was finally under the care of the
ZW02n0000_p0006a03_## same library, and has been kept there up to now. Originally, both
ZW02n0000_p0006a04_## numbers were of the same fascicle, and it is to be regretted that
ZW02n0000_p0006a05_## some parts in between have been missing, and therefore they cannot
ZW02n0000_p0006a06_## be straightly joined together. The colophon at the end of the second
ZW02n0000_p0006a07_## number names it as the "xiajuan" ("concluded fascicle", viz. the second
ZW02n0000_p0006a08_## of two or the last of three, according to the layout characteristics
ZW02n0000_p0006a09_## of Chinese publications) of the text; therefore, the original work
ZW02n0000_p0006a10_## should have two or three fascicles. And it is hard to identify who
ZW02n0000_p0006a11_## this Qizu (the Seventh Guru) was now. However, it seems to me
ZW02n0000_p0006a12_## that he should belong to the Northern Chan School, according to the
ZW02n0000_p0006a13_## ideological inclination in the text. <it>The Tianzhuguo Putidamo
ZW02n0000_p0006a14_## Chanshi Lun</it> has already been published in the first number of <it>the
ZW02n0000_p0006a15_## Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka</it>. As the explanatory
ZW02n0000_p0006a16_## note on the title of the text therein says, it is commonplace for
ZW02n0000_p0006a17_## Buddhist scriptures to be supplemented with new contents or undergo
ZW02n0000_p0006a18_## transmutation while being copied. If any different versions of a
ZW02n0000_p0006a19_## text do appear during its [dissmimation>dissemination], these versions should be collated
ZW02n0000_p0006a20_## respectively. However, it is [re latively>relatively] complicated whether
ZW02n0000_p0006a21_## some texts should be regarded as the different versions. Consequently,
ZW02n0000_p0006a22_## after the different versions of the text have been edited and
ZW02n0000_p0006a23_## merged into one in the first number of our book, we are here to collate
ZW02n0000_p0006a24_## its two different versions [in dividually>individually] in this very number,
ZW02n0000_p0006a25_## which is in our opinion a new experiment in collating such texts. We
ZW02n0000_p0006a26_## sincerely welcome any [cri ticism>criticism] in this aspect.
ZW02n0000_p0006a27_##<p,0,2>The column "Commentaries on the Tripitaka" brings forth two
ZW02n0000_p0006a28_## texts: <it>the Jing Ming Jing Ji Jie Guan Zhong Shu</it> and <it>the Fa Hua
ZW02n0000_p0007a01_## Jing Wen Wai Yi</it>.
ZW02n0000_p0007a02_##<p,0,2><it>The Jing Ming Jing Ji Jie Guan Zhong Shu</it>, collected by
ZW02n0000_p0007a03_## <it>Daoye</it> in the Tang Dynasty (618907), is a comparatively important
ZW02n0000_p0007a04_## one of the extant commentaries on <it>Vimalakirtinirdesasutra</it>. A
ZW02n0000_p0007a05_## number of [ver sions>versions] of this commentary have been found among the
ZW02n0000_p0007a06_## surviving books from Dunhuang. It drew research workers' attention
ZW02n0000_p0007a07_## long ago and has been collected into the 85th volume of <it>the
ZW02n0000_p0007a08_## Dazhengzang</it>. Unfortunately, the commentary included in <it>the
ZW02n0000_p0007a09_## Dazhengzang</it> lacked accurate and comprehensive collation, and more
ZW02n0000_p0007a10_## than 10 thousand Chinese [charac ters>characters] from the latter half of the fifth
ZW02n0000_p0007a11_## Pin (chapter) to the first half of the [sventh>seventh] pin have been missing;
ZW02n0000_p0007a12_## therefore, the publication of the collated text here is in fact the first
ZW02n0000_p0007a13_## time for the [com plete>complete] text of the commentary to see the light of
ZW02n0000_p0007a14_## day. The [commen tary>commentary], consisting of two fascicles, is fairly
ZW02n0000_p0007a15_##  [lenghthy>lengthy]. As a result of the limited space of this number, we now
ZW02n0000_p0007a16_## just bring forth the first fascicle, and the second one will come into
ZW02n0000_p0007a17_## being in the third number of our book.
ZW02n0000_p0007a18_##<p,0,2>Also sifted out from the [suriving>surviving] books from Dunhuang is <it>the
ZW02n0000_p0007a19_## Fa Hua Jing Wen Wai Yi, </it>a commentary on <it>the Fahuajing (Saddharmapunda
ZW02n0000_p0007a20_## rikasutra)</it>. The author of this text is unknown, for
ZW02n0000_p0007a21_## he has never been recorded in any catalogs of the Buddhist Canon
ZW02n0000_p0007a22_## through the ages. The [origional>original] text is now kept in the Shanghai
ZW02n0000_p0007a23_## Museum. As the title of the text suggests, it lays no stress on
ZW02n0000_p0007a24_## straightening out the words and phrases of <it>the Fahuajing</it>. Instead,
ZW02n0000_p0007a25_## drawing forth a number of questions from <it>the Fahuajing</it>, the author
ZW02n0000_p0007a26_## gave them [spe cific>specific] expositions in his text, from which one can
ZW02n0000_p0007a27_## get a hint of the major questions and theoretical tendencies with regard
ZW02n0000_p0007a28_## to the then studies of <it>the Fahuajing</it>. Copied in 545 A.D.
ZW02n0000_p0008a01_## during the reign of the Western Wei Dynasty, the manuscript has
ZW02n0000_p0008a02_## preserved considerable ancient forms of Chinese characters used in
ZW02n0000_p0008a03_## the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the wording
ZW02n0000_p0008a04_## and phrasing therein are slightly of colloquial flavor; therefore, it is
ZW02n0000_p0008a05_## of a certain value to any one who makes studies of the then languages
ZW02n0000_p0008a06_## and characters.
ZW02n0000_p0008a07_##<p,0,2>The section "Important Texts from India" publishes <it>the Di Yi

ZW02n0000_p0008a10_## still one of the very influential religious sects in India today. Jainism
ZW02n0000_p0008a11_## and Buddhism emerged in the same age and same place, and had followers
ZW02n0000_p0008a12_## of roughly identical social levels. As a result, both religions
ZW02n0000_p0008a13_## share many a common or similar point in their doctrines. To study
ZW02n0000_p0008a14_## Jainism is a must for any one who studies Buddhism, especially the
ZW02n0000_p0008a15_## early Buddhism, which has become a common understanding in the
ZW02n0000_p0008a16_## Buddhist research circles in the world. It is a pity that no one in China
ZW02n0000_p0008a17_## has ever translated a Jain scripture into Chinese in the past two
ZW02n0000_p0008a18_## thousand years except for some introduction in the Buddhist scriptures.
ZW02n0000_p0008a19_## Among the numerous Jain scriptures, only the Di Yi Zheng De
ZW02n0000_p0008a20_## Jing is one jointly revered and followed by two great sects, viz. the
ZW02n0000_p0008a21_## Svetambara and the Digambara, and it is also publicly accepted as
ZW02n0000_p0008a22_## the most essential text dealing with the Jain doctrine, hence the
ZW02n0000_p0008a23_## translated version here. China's Buddhists have had the tradition to
ZW02n0000_p0008a24_## collect India's cultic texts into the Dazang jing, such as <it>Chen Zhendi'</it>s
ZW02n0000_p0008a25_## [traslation>translation] of <it>the Suvarnasaptati Sastra</it>, a work of ancient India's
ZW02n0000_p0008a26_## Samkhya School, and the Tang monk <it>Xuan zang'</it>s translation
ZW02n0000_p0008a27_## of <it>Dasapadarthasastra</it>, a work of ancient India's Vaisesika
ZW02n0000_p0008a28_## School, etc.. Following this tradition, we have included this <it>Di Yi

ZW02n0000_p0009a02_## Tripitaka</it> to offer it to our readers.

ZW02n0000_p0009a06_## later years.
ZW02n0000_p0009a07_##<p,0,2>Tracing his own academic experience throughout his life in this
ZW02n0000_p0009a08_## paper, Mr. Han Qingjing expounds the significance of <it>the Yogacara
ZW02n0000_p0009a09_## bhumi Sastra</it> in "carrying forward the essentials of authentic
ZW02n0000_p0009a10_## Buddhism." Therefore, this paper can serve as important reference
ZW02n0000_p0009a11_## material for one to make studies of Mr. Han Qingjing's thinking. In
ZW02n0000_p0009a12_## addition, the author points out in his paper that there are many errors
ZW02n0000_p0009a13_## in writing in the Sanskrit original of <it>the Yogacarabhumi Sastra</it>.
ZW02n0000_p0009a14_## This really deserves our great attention, for the author has corrected
ZW02n0000_p0009a15_## the mistakes passed on for more than one thousand years. It is
ZW02n0000_p0009a16_## indeed delighting and amazing for this important paper to be published
ZW02n0000_p0009a17_## for the first time after it has gone through all kinds of
ZW02n0000_p0009a18_## disasters.
ZW02n0000_p0009a19_##<p,0,2>Dazangjing, an accumulation of China's Buddhist essences
ZW02n0000_p0009a20_## through generations, is a cultural treasure that we Chinese people
ZW02n0000_p0009a21_## have contributed to the world. Since the Northern and Southern Dynasties,
ZW02n0000_p0009a22_## all the successive dynasties in China had maintained two traditions:
ZW02n0000_p0009a23_## one was to compile the Dazangjing, another one was to
ZW02n0000_p0009a24_## write the official history, forming two grand humanistic views in
ZW02n0000_p0009a25_## parallel with each other in China's history. Our country is now in
ZW02n0000_p0009a26_## its heyday again. If we can compile a new Dazangjing, we shall be
ZW02n0000_p0009a27_## able to benefit generation after generation. We sincerely hope that
ZW02n0000_p0009a28_## we Chinese people at home and abroad, the peoples of the countries
ZW02n0000_p0010a01_## in the Chinese Buddhist cultural sphere, and personages of the Buddhist
ZW02n0000_p0010a02_## and academic circles, can all join hands and dedicate our selves
ZW02n0000_p0010a03_## to the cause of compiling a new Dazangjing that can include our present
ZW02n0000_p0010a04_## accomplishments and set a fine example for posterity.

ZW02n0000_p0011a05_##<p,0,2>大藏經は中國佛教の永年にわたる精華の蓄積であり、中國
ZW02n0000_p0011a06_##人が世界に寄與してきた文化的遺產である。南北朝時代以來、
ZW02n0000_p0011a07_##歷代にわたり大藏經の編纂が手がけられたことは、正史の纂修
ZW02n0000_p0011a08_##事業とともに、中國歷史の上における偉觀といえよう。近代に
ZW02n0000_p0011a09_##至り、佛教への認識が深まるにしたがつて，新たに大藏經を編纂
ZW02n0000_p0011a10_##しようという動きが湧き起こつてきた。また現在は電子版書籍
ZW02n0000_p0011a11_##の急速な發展にともない、國內外から電子版大藏經編纂の呼び
ZW02n0000_p0011a12_##かけも日々高まつている。こうした情勢のもと、今年4月9日、
ZW02n0000_p0011a13_##10日の2日間にわたり、國務院宗教事務局の主宰による「大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0011a14_##の編纂およびそのコンピユ—タ—に入力に關する學術研究討論
ZW02n0000_p0011a15_##會」略稱「大藏經プロジエクト研究討論會」が開かれ、北京の學術
ZW02n0000_p0011a16_##界、宗教界の40人近い專門家、大德が參加した。參加者は忌憚
ZW02n0000_p0011a17_##なく發言し、中國の最高水準を示す大藏經編纂の重要性と必要
ZW02n0000_p0011a18_##性およびその可能性について、さまざまの角度から十分な檢討
ZW02n0000_p0011a19_##がなされた。これは中國の大藏經編纂事業が新しいステ—ジに
ZW02n0000_p0011a20_##入つたことを意味する重要會議であつた。注目すべきことに、
ZW02n0000_p0011a21_##同じく4月上旬に臺灣の佛光山でも、同じテ—マの國際學術研
ZW02n0000_p0011a22_##究討論會が開催された。このことは海峽兩岸の中國人と國際社
ZW02n0000_p0011a23_##會とがひとしくこの事業に關心を抱いていることを示してい
ZW02n0000_p0011a24_##る。大藏經の編纂に盡力することは、もとよりわれわれ《藏外佛

ZW02n0000_p0012a01_##催されたことに對し、心から祝意を表したい。會議の主催者の

ZW02n0000_p0012a15_##<p,0,2>《藏外佛教文獻》第二輯に收めたその他の文獻は次のとおり
ZW02n0000_p0012a16_##である。
ZW02n0000_p0012a17_##<p,0,2>「敦煌禪籍」の部には敦煌文獻二篇が收める。第一の《七祖
ZW02n0000_p0012a18_##法寶記》は、全篇經典の引用より成り、《諸經要集》と同じ體裁を
ZW02n0000_p0012a19_##もつ、きわめて珍しい禪宗文獻である。從來、中國の禪宗につい
ZW02n0000_p0012a20_##ては、「經論に依らず、文字を立てず」と言われているが，この《七
ZW02n0000_p0012a21_##祖法寶記》は文字を立て、經論に依り、なおかつ到るところ經論
ZW02n0000_p0012a22_##を引いて自說の證據とするやりかたである。この文獻は從來の
ZW02n0000_p0012a23_##經錄にまたつく著錄されず、最近になつて北京圖書館において
ZW02n0000_p0012a24_##再發現されたものである。2點あるうち、1點は敦煌から北京に
ZW02n0000_p0012a25_##搬送されて以來、北京圖書館に保存されながら、鑒定もされず、
ZW02n0000_p0013a01_##公開もされなかつた。もう1點はかつて散逸し、そののち北京圖
ZW02n0000_p0013a02_##書館の收藏に歸したものである。この2點はもとひとつの寫本
ZW02n0000_p0013a03_##であつて、殘念ながら中間部を缺いており、直接にはつながわな
ZW02n0000_p0013a04_##い。尾題には「下卷」とあるから、もとは二卷ないし三卷であつ
ZW02n0000_p0013a05_##たはずである。ここに言う七祖は誰であるがは，なお斷定しが
ZW02n0000_p0013a06_##たいが、本文の思想傾向から見て、おそらく北宗禪の人であろう
ZW02n0000_p0013a07_##と思われる。
ZW02n0000_p0013a08_##<p,0,2>第二の《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》は、すでに第一輯に整理發
ZW02n0000_p0013a09_##表したが、その解題に述べたように，佛典は傳寫の過程で增廣變
ZW02n0000_p0013a10_##容を繅り返すものであり、もし傳承過程に異本を形成したなら
ZW02n0000_p0013a11_##ば、それは別に本文を整理すべきである。しかし種類によつて
ZW02n0000_p0013a12_##は異本とみなすべきか、複雜な情況を呈するものがある。今回
ZW02n0000_p0013a13_##は第一輯に整理して一篇としたものを、あらためて別々に整理
ZW02n0000_p0013a14_##して二篇に分け、この種の文獻整理の新しい試みとした。敬し
ZW02n0000_p0013a15_##んで識者の批評を待ちたい。
ZW02n0000_p0013a16_##<p,0,2>「三藏論疏」の部には2篇の文獻を收める。第一の《淨名經
ZW02n0000_p0013a17_##集解關中疏》は唐の道液集。現存する《維摩詰所說經》の註疏の
ZW02n0000_p0013a18_##うちの比較的重要な著作である。この疏は敦煌遺書中に多く存
ZW02n0000_p0013a19_##し、研究者にも早くより注目されて、《大正藏》第85卷に收錄さ
ZW02n0000_p0013a20_##れている。ただ殘念なことに《大正藏》のこの部分の校勘は慎重
ZW02n0000_p0013a21_##を缺き、第五品の後半から第七品の前半部分1萬字餘りの脫漏
ZW02n0000_p0013a22_##がある。したがつて本輯に整理發表したものは、疏の全容の初
ZW02n0000_p0013a23_##公開であるが、上下二卷のうち、紙幅の都合で本輯には上卷のみ
ZW02n0000_p0013a24_##揭載し、下卷を第三輯にまわさざるを得なかつた。
ZW02n0000_p0013a25_##<p,0,2>第二の《法華經文外義》は《法華經》の註疏であるが、これも
ZW02n0000_p0014a01_##敦煌遺書によつて整理した。作者は不詳、歷代の經錄にも著錄
ZW02n0000_p0014a02_##がない。原寫本は現在上海博物館。內容は表題が示すとおり、
ZW02n0000_p0014a03_##《法華經》の文句の疏釋を意圖したものではなく、もつぱら經典
ZW02n0000_p0014a04_##から若干の問題を抽出し專門的な論述をおこなつている。ここ
ZW02n0000_p0014a05_##から當時の《法華經》研究の主要な問題と理論的傾向を知ること
ZW02n0000_p0014a06_##ができる。この寫本は西魏大統11年（545）に書寫されたもの
ZW02n0000_p0014a07_##で、相當數にのぼる南北朝時代の古體字を留め、また語言表現に
ZW02n0000_p0014a08_##はやや口語的色彩を帶びており、南北朝時代の言語、文字の研究
ZW02n0000_p0014a09_##に有用な資料である。
ZW02n0000_p0014a10_##<p,0,2>「天竺要典」の部にはインドのジヤイナ教の主要な典籍《諦
ZW02n0000_p0014a11_##義證得經》を收める。ジヤイナ教とは佛典に謂うところ「尼乾外
ZW02n0000_p0014a12_##道」であつて、いまなおインドに大きな影響力をもつている。ジ
ZW02n0000_p0014a13_##ヤイナ教と佛教は同じ時代、同じ地域に生まれ、ほぼ同じ社會階
ZW02n0000_p0014a14_##層の信者をもつた。ゆえに兩者の教義には一致し、あるいは類
ZW02n0000_p0014a15_##似するところが多い。佛教の研究、とりわけ初期佛教の研究に
ZW02n0000_p0014a16_##はジヤイナ教の研究が必要であることは、すでに世界の佛教學
ZW02n0000_p0014a17_##界の共通の認識となつているが、遺憾なことに、佛典中に紹介さ
ZW02n0000_p0014a18_##れている以外、二千年來わが國にはジヤイナ教の經典の翻譯紹
ZW02n0000_p0014a19_##介がなかつた。《諦義證得經》はジヤイナ教の多くの經典の中、
ZW02n0000_p0014a20_##白衣派．空衣派がともに尊ぶ唯一のもので、公認されたジヤイナ
ZW02n0000_p0014a21_##教教義を論述するもつとも精要な經典であるゆえに、ここに譯
ZW02n0000_p0014a22_##載することとなつた。中國佛教には、例えば，陳の真諦譯のイン
ZW02n0000_p0014a23_##ド數論派の著作《金七十論》、唐の玄奘譯のインド勝論派の著作
ZW02n0000_p0014a24_##《勝宗十句義論》なと、インドの外道の典籍をも大藏經に加える
ZW02n0000_p0014a25_##傳統がある。これに從い、われわれはこの《諦義證得經》を《藏外
ZW02n0000_p0015a01_##佛教文獻》に收めて，讀者に提供するものである。
ZW02n0000_p0015a02_##<p,0,2>「遺珠集粹」の部には近代の有名な佛教學者韓清淨氏晚年の
ZW02n0000_p0015a03_##重要な論文《瑜伽師地論披尋記敘》を收める。韓清淨氏はこの論
ZW02n0000_p0015a04_##文で、自ら半生にわたる學問的探求を追憶し、《瑜伽師地論》が
ZW02n0000_p0015a05_##「真實の佛教の精義を宣揚している」ことの意義を明らかにして
ZW02n0000_p0015a06_##いる。したがつてこれは韓清淨氏の思想を研究するにも重要な
ZW02n0000_p0015a07_##資料となるであろう。本論文は《瑜伽師地論》の梵文原本に多く
ZW02n0000_p0015a08_##の錯簡が存することを指摘して、その千載に覆われた真實を明
ZW02n0000_p0015a09_##らかにした注目すべき研究であり、しかもこれが幾度にもわた
ZW02n0000_p0015a10_##る災難をくぐり、數奇な運命をたどつた末にここに、初めて公開
ZW02n0000_p0015a11_##されたここは、じつに驚くべく喜ばしいことである。

ZW02n0000_p0019a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0019a04I##<p,0,2>一、整理者應儘量收齊所整理典籍的各種文本，以供校勘之
ZW02n0000_p0019a05_##用。
ZW02n0000_p0019a06_##<p,0,2>如收集到的文本的數量少於十種，則全部用於校勘。如數量
ZW02n0000_p0019a07_##超過十種，則可根據具體情況在其中選擇有代表性的若干文本（十
ZW02n0000_p0019a08_##種左右）用於校勘，而將其它文本在題解或附錄中一一予以說明。
ZW02n0000_p0019a09_##如文本數量超過二十種，則不必一一說明，但應該列舉主要文本
ZW02n0000_p0019a10_##（不少於二十種）的名稱（或編號、出處）。
ZW02n0000_p0019a11_##<p,0,2>如因某些文本錯漏甚多，或因其他理由，亦可不按上述規定列
ZW02n0000_p0019a12_##為校本，或祇利用其準確的部分，但必須予以說明。
ZW02n0000_p0019a13_##<p,0,2>確定用於校勘的文本後，於其中指定某本作為底本，而將其餘
ZW02n0000_p0019a14_##諸本指定為校本。校本以天干次序排列。底校本的指定情況在題
ZW02n0000_p0019a15_##解中予以交代。如果底本乃由若干文本拼合而成，則在題解中以
ZW02n0000_p0019a16_##「底本由某本、某本、某本依次拼合而成，具體情況隨文說明」這樣
ZW02n0000_p0019a17_##的語句敘述之，並在正文中隨文說明諸本作為底本之拼合起訖。
ZW02n0000_p0019a18_##在這種情況下，凡某本在某段文字中被指定為底本，則其餘諸本
ZW02n0000_p0019a19_##（包括在其餘文字中曾經作為底本使用的文本）一律作為校本。
ZW02n0000_p0019a20I##<p,0,2>二、整理者撰寫題解一篇，內容一般依次為經名、異名、定性
ZW02n0000_p0019a21_##語、著譯者、卷數、內容簡介、研究價值、流傳概況（包括歷代經錄有
ZW02n0000_p0019a22_##無著錄）、異本、整理本所用底、校本情況等。題解置於整理本之
ZW02n0000_p0019a23_##前。
ZW02n0000_p0019a24_##<p,0,2>歡迎整理者對所整理文獻作文獻學方面考證研究，題目自定，
ZW02n0000_p0019a25_##一般作為附錄載於原文獻之後。
ZW02n0000_p0019a26I##<p,0,2>三、校勘錄文時，如遇異文，整理者應慎重考訂，選擇其最準確
ZW02n0000_p0019a27_##者納入整理本，以吸收諸本精華；而將諸本之異文一概納入校記，
ZW02n0000_p0019a28_##以供研究者參考。
ZW02n0000_p0020a01I##<p,0,2>四、校錄時，因原文本殘缺而使文獻首、中、尾殘缺者，以「（首
ZW02n0000_p0020a02_##殘）」、「（中殘）」、「（尾殘）」表示之。
ZW02n0000_p0020a03_##<p,0,2>如文本不殘，但抄寫者未抄完整而使文獻殘缺者，則分別以
ZW02n0000_p0020a04_##「（首缺）」、「（中缺）」、「（尾缺）」表示之。
ZW02n0000_p0020a05I##<p,0,2>五、因底本殘缺而使文字殘缺者，以「□」表示之。殘字可考字
ZW02n0000_p0020a06_##數者，一字一「□」。殘字不可考字數者，以「□…□」表示之。
ZW02n0000_p0020a07I##<p,0,2>六、原文雖然殘缺，但尚留有殘字筆痕可據以擬補，或可據上
ZW02n0000_p0020a08_##下文意、其它文獻擬補者，予以補出。此時出校記說明補正依據。
ZW02n0000_p0020a09I##<p,0,2>七、原文本因抄寫者未抄而留下的空格，錄文時如可以擬補
ZW02n0000_p0020a10_##者，仿照上條擬補之。如不可擬補者，以「□」表示之，出校記說明。
ZW02n0000_p0020a11_##但如果屬於行文格式需要之換行空、敬空等，照錄原文，不出校記。
ZW02n0000_p0020a12I##<p,0,2>八、校本如有殘缺，則略去不校，亦不出校記。
ZW02n0000_p0020a13I##<p,0,2>九、校記的原則：逢異必出，儘量簡略，達意為主。
ZW02n0000_p0020a14_##<p,0,2>如底本正確，則應在校記中羅列諸本異文，如：
ZW02n0000_p0020a15_##<p,0,2>「白」，甲、乙本作「黑」，丙本作「紅」，丁本無。
ZW02n0000_p0020a16_##<p,0,2>如底本錯誤，則據他本改正錄文後，校記作：
ZW02n0000_p0020a17_##<p,0,2>「黑」，底、戊本作「白」，丙本作「紅」，丁本無，據甲、乙本改。
ZW02n0000_p0020a18_##<p,0,2>如底本漏字據某本補，或底本衍字據某本刪，則校記註明為
ZW02n0000_p0020a19_##「據某本補」或「據某本刪」。
ZW02n0000_p0020a20_##<p,0,2>雖無校本依據，但行文明顯錯誤者，可進行理校，出校記說明。
ZW02n0000_p0020a21_##如無把握，可原文照錄，而把理校意見記入校記。
ZW02n0000_p0020a22_##<p,0,2>必要時可出解釋性、研究性校記，但應文字簡練。
ZW02n0000_p0020a23I##<p,0,2>十、古今字、異體字、正俗字、武周新字一律改為標準繁體字，
ZW02n0000_p0020a24_##不出校記。原文筆誤、筆劃增減及變體者，徑直改為正字，不出校
ZW02n0000_p0020a25_##記。
ZW02n0000_p0020a26_##<p,0,2>錯別字改為正字，出校記。如在同一篇文獻中某些錯別字反
ZW02n0000_p0020a27_##覆出現，則僅在首次出現時予以註出，其後不再一一出校記。
ZW02n0000_p0020a28_##<p,0,2>通假字第一次出現時改為正字，出校記；以後徑直改為正字，
ZW02n0000_p0021a01_##不出校記。
ZW02n0000_p0021a02_##<p,0,2>專有名詞中的字一律照錄，不作改動。

ZW02n0000_p0021a07_##文有塗改者，祇錄改正後的文字。不能確定哪些是改正後的文字
ZW02n0000_p0021a08_##者，酌選其一，而將其餘文字錄寫在校記中。原文寫在行外的補
ZW02n0000_p0021a09_##字，錄文時補入行內，不出校記。不能確定補在何處者，錄寫在校
ZW02n0000_p0021a10_##記中。
ZW02n0000_p0021a11I##<p,0,2>十二、引文能查核原出處者，儘量查核，此時加引號，並註明出
ZW02n0000_p0021a12_##處。一時查不到原出處，但可以確定首尾者，加引號。不能確定其

ZW02n0000_p0022a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0022a05Q2#一.開頭語（1996年4月9日）
ZW02n0000_p0022a06_##
ZW02n0000_p0022a07_##<p,0,2>這次研討會的主題是討論大藏經工程及其電腦化問題。我先
ZW02n0000_p0022a08_##談幾點意見。
ZW02n0000_p0022a09_##<p,0,2>開這個會，主要是想推進這項工程的完成。其實更有資格、更
ZW02n0000_p0022a10_##有權威主持這件事的是中國社會科學院、中國佛教協會等。由於
ZW02n0000_p0022a11_##大德長老、專家學者的建議，這一工程涉及宗教文化、宗教事業，作
ZW02n0000_p0022a12_##為宗教事務中的大事，宗教局理應做一些協調、服務工作。這次會
ZW02n0000_p0022a13_##議就是為大家提供一個場所議一議。
ZW02n0000_p0022a14_##<p,0,2>從宗教事務的角度，就大藏經工程，我們有三個方面的考慮：
ZW02n0000_p0022a15_##<p,0,2>1.從做功德的角度看，這是盛世修典。當然我們不是從信仰
ZW02n0000_p0022a16_##者的角度來說的。大家知道，我們文化古國有著悠久深厚的文化
ZW02n0000_p0022a17_##傳統，既重武功，也重文治。所謂文治，其中重要的一項就是始終
ZW02n0000_p0022a18_##十分重視對我們祖先積澱下來的文化的繼承與整理。從先秦孔子
ZW02n0000_p0022a19_##整理儒家六經開始，歷代有志於文化典籍整理的人士前赴後繼，層
ZW02n0000_p0022a20_##出不窮，孜孜以求。歷朝歷代也把古籍的搜求、編目、整理作為大
ZW02n0000_p0022a21_##事，從而吸收融合了各種文化，融彙了各種學派，體現了中國文化
ZW02n0000_p0022a22_##恢宏的氣魄和博大的胸懷。中華民族之所以有如此的凝聚力，主
ZW02n0000_p0022a23_##要來源於各民族統一的文化，正是她維繫了我們中華民族的魂魄
ZW02n0000_p0022a24_##和精神。文獻典籍是文化遺產的載體，佛教大藏經是我國文獻典
ZW02n0000_p0022a25_##籍中數量最多，影響最大的部分之一。
ZW02n0000_p0022a26_##<p,0,2>經過十多年的改革開放，社會穩定，經濟繁榮。特別是在面對
ZW02n0000_p0022a27_##跨世紀的宏偉目標，我們中華民族要實現偉大復興，自立自強於世
ZW02n0000_p0023a01_##界民族之林的歷史機遇的時候，重新編印大藏經這份寶貴文化遺
ZW02n0000_p0023a02_##產，特別是運用現代科技手段，實現電腦化，對於弘揚中華民族優
ZW02n0000_p0023a03_##良傳統，吸收人類文明優秀成果，重構中華民族的人文精神，有著
ZW02n0000_p0023a04_##極為深遠的意義。
ZW02n0000_p0023a05_##<p,0,2>佛教產生於印度，但由於種種原因，在印度已經衰落。就目前
ZW02n0000_p0023a06_##而言，中國是佛教的真正故鄉，完整的佛教及其典籍都保存在中
ZW02n0000_p0023a07_##國，所以配合現代科技，重編一部最完備、最精要的大藏經，非常必
ZW02n0000_p0023a08_##要。以前，很多專家已做過這方面的工作，像任繼愈先生等，積累
ZW02n0000_p0023a09_##了很多經驗。特別是趙樸老，很早就有志於此，特派五位比丘赴斯
ZW02n0000_p0023a10_##里蘭卡留學，為此作準備。
ZW02n0000_p0023a11_##<p,0,2>2.從功利角度來說，當然不是為了賺錢，而是為了引導宗教與
ZW02n0000_p0023a12_##社會主義社會相適應。趙樸老多次提到，宗教是一種文化，對我們
ZW02n0000_p0023a13_##有很大啟示。我們通過辦這件事，可以促進宗教提高其品位，引導
ZW02n0000_p0023a14_##和推動宗教的文化取向，倫理取向、哲學取向。
ZW02n0000_p0023a15_##<p,0,2>3.從功用角度看，世界上都在搞Internet，搞信息高速公路建
ZW02n0000_p0023a16_##設。雖然信息高速公路已被西方所壟斷，但若把大藏經電腦化，推
ZW02n0000_p0023a17_##向信息高速公路，對世界文化也是做出了貢獻。亨廷頓提倡「文明
ZW02n0000_p0023a18_##衝突論」，但我們認為，如能把這項工程完成，其實是一種「文明的
ZW02n0000_p0023a19_##對話論」，這將具有很高很深的含意。以中華民族恢宏的氣魄和博
ZW02n0000_p0023a20_##大的胸懷是能夠與西方文化對話的。我們不怕滲透，也需要更積
ZW02n0000_p0023a21_##極、更主動地吸收外來文化的優秀成果，有效地抵制滲透。大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0023a22_##工程是否有這幾方面的意義，還要請在座的專家學者論證。
ZW02n0000_p0023a23_##<p,0,2>宗教局在這件事中將起到什麼樣的作用呢？這項工程作為重
ZW02n0000_p0023a24_##要的宗教文化事業，將涉及許多宗教事務，我們將儘我們的力量，
ZW02n0000_p0023a25_##做推動、協調工作。通過開這個研討會，爭取形成一個可行性的報
ZW02n0000_p0023a26_##告；與有關部門聯係，取得他們的支持；請高僧大德領銜掛帥；還要
ZW02n0000_p0023a27_##發揮社會主義辦大事的優勢；最後落實到專家學者們艱苦卓絕的
ZW02n0000_p0023a28_##勞動上。宗教局就是具體辦事，具體服務。
ZW02n0000_p0024a01_##
ZW02n0000_p0024a02Q2#二.結束語（1996年4月10日）
ZW02n0000_p0024a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0024a04_##<p,0,2>講三句話。
ZW02n0000_p0024a05_##<p,0,2>1.見仁見智，很受教益。
ZW02n0000_p0024a06_##<p,0,2>通過兩天的研討，碰到一系列矛盾：說起來做這件事功德無
ZW02n0000_p0024a07_##量，但如何具體操作，工程浩繁，非常艱巨；我們想要搞一個最完
ZW02n0000_p0024a08_##備、最精要、最通行的藏經，但人才、經費都是舉步維艱；既要抓住
ZW02n0000_p0024a09_##良機，努力去做，又不能輕舉妄動；做這件事，官方不能不管，但主
ZW02n0000_p0024a10_##要又得靠信仰者。既要出書冊版，又要出光電版，也是個矛盾。但
ZW02n0000_p0024a11_##總之，這些矛盾都體現了必要性和可行性的辯證統一。老祖宗留
ZW02n0000_p0024a12_##下的寶貴遺產不能丟，電腦和信息時代給我們提供的歷史機遇也
ZW02n0000_p0024a13_##不能錯過。古人云「但存方寸地，留與子孫耕」，我們要為子孫留下
ZW02n0000_p0024a14_##方寸地。
ZW02n0000_p0024a15_##<p,0,2>2.愚公移山，眾志成城。
ZW02n0000_p0024a16_##<p,0,2>這項工程要分三步走。第一步，策動。第一要得到中央的重
ZW02n0000_p0024a17_##視，全民的關注，尤其是全體佛教徒的關注。要形成一個會議紀
ZW02n0000_p0024a18_##要，搞好宣傳工作。第二要仔細研究，出一本書，對這項工程作出
ZW02n0000_p0024a19_##具體科學的論證。第三要寫出報告。這項工程要採取民辦官助的
ZW02n0000_p0024a20_##形式。以中國佛教協會、中國社會科學院世界宗教研究所、中國綜
ZW02n0000_p0024a21_##合研究開發院聯合起草一個報告，我局協助爭取有關部門支持。
ZW02n0000_p0024a22_##第二步，啟動。如果各方面條件具備，宗教局出面做以下工作：（1）
ZW02n0000_p0024a23_##組織機構問題，組織佛教界和專家學者形成類似工程指導委員會
ZW02n0000_p0024a24_##式的組織機構，並組成工作班子。（2）經費問題，有幾條路：一是靠
ZW02n0000_p0024a25_##佛協吸引信仰者集資。二是依託某一名山大寺、高僧大德。三是
ZW02n0000_p0024a26_##成立一個基金會作為後援。四是同國際慣例接軌，講求經濟效益，
ZW02n0000_p0024a27_##實行自養。（3）具體實施按兩條腿走路的方針，一方面電腦版先
ZW02n0000_p0024a28_##行，建立數據庫；另一方面趁老專家健在，組織班子搞前期編纂工
ZW02n0000_p0025a01_##作。兩方面要互補，佛學專家學點電腦，電腦專家粗通佛典。第三
ZW02n0000_p0025a02_##步，滾動。這涉及到對遠景的規劃。臺灣雜誌說，「電子佛典萬馬
ZW02n0000_p0025a03_##奔騰，亟待整合」。問題是如何整合，怎樣保持知識產權。我們要
ZW02n0000_p0025a04_##佔據制高點，把海內外、國內外的有關的資料都彙聚到我們的大藏
ZW02n0000_p0025a05_##經之內，要海納百川、有容乃大，要有大海吞雲吐霧、百川歸流的魄
ZW02n0000_p0025a06_##力。將來還可以考慮開一個國際性的會議，把世界範圍的專家學
ZW02n0000_p0025a07_##者請到一起，達成一致意見，成立一個國際性的協調機構。當然這
ZW02n0000_p0025a08_##屬於浪漫主義的遠景目標。
ZW02n0000_p0025a09_##<p,0,2>3.要有民族精神，誓願精誠。
ZW02n0000_p0025a10_##<p,0,2>我們要實現民族的偉大復興，這一大藏經的工程就屬於民族
ZW02n0000_p0025a11_##復興工程。像吳立民先生說的，要有三力合和：即要有功德力，發
ZW02n0000_p0025a12_##本誓悲願；又要有「佛的加持力」，得到信仰者的廣泛支持；還要有
ZW02n0000_p0025a13_##法界力，要靠中央、靠政府，靠社會主義社會的優越性。總之，這一
ZW02n0000_p0025a14_##工程困難會很大，但正因為它難，纔更有價值。我們要有信仰者那
ZW02n0000_p0025a15_##樣的執著追求精神。就像恩格斯在馬克思墓前說的，馬克思做了
ZW02n0000_p0025a16_##那麼多努力，他還是死了，但後人在他的成就面前會流下崇高的眼
ZW02n0000_p0025a17_##淚。

ZW02n0000_p0026a02Q2#關於新編漢文大藏經的意見
ZW02n0000_p0026a03A##吳立民
ZW02n0000_p0026a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0026a05_##<p,0,2>漢文大藏經，自唐《開元錄》一直到日本《大正藏》，迄今已有二
ZW02n0000_p0026a06_##十多種版本藏經，在各個不同歷史時期，都曾作過奉獻和起過作
ZW02n0000_p0026a07_##用，是人類文明史上最寶貴的文化遺產。現在完整的佛教和完整
ZW02n0000_p0026a08_##的佛藏基本上都在中國。為融合古今中外一切佛法，以適應世界
ZW02n0000_p0026a09_##佛教時代，普攝人間群機，實有重新編修漢文大藏經之必要。有鑒
ZW02n0000_p0026a10_##於斯，近幾十年來，有志弘法之士，莫不關注此事。臺灣有中華佛
ZW02n0000_p0026a11_##教會屈映光等修訂《中華大藏經》之纂輯，佛光山有《佛光大藏經》
ZW02n0000_p0026a12_##的編印，大陸前有周叔迦先生集中木刻經板刊印《金陵大藏經》之
ZW02n0000_p0026a13_##策劃，呂澂先生有《新編漢文大藏經目錄》之著作，現有中國古藉領
ZW02n0000_p0026a14_##導小組重修《中華大藏經》之出版。但茲事體大，既非一人一地之
ZW02n0000_p0026a15_##力，亦非一朝一夕之功，非法緣成熟，難以完全辦好。目前收輯較

ZW02n0000_p0026a23_##入藏者不少，雖有續藏，未能顧及。三是實用不大方便，有些經論，
ZW02n0000_p0026a24_##一直沒有斷句標點，校勘索引很不精審，錯訛太多，圖像零亂無序，
ZW02n0000_p0026a25_##應有附錄全付闕如。而且《大正藏》為日本所輯，非中華所出，許多
ZW02n0000_p0026a26_##中土著述未能收入。作為現存佛教和佛藏最完整的中國，理應重
ZW02n0000_p0026a27_##新編修中華大藏經。而由國家主修現正印行的《中華大藏經》，除
ZW02n0000_p0027a01_##版本校勘有其優勝外，體例一仍其舊，收集未見完整，更不方便實
ZW02n0000_p0027a02_##用，且價值昂貴，非常人之所能問津。因此由中國佛教協會籌劃重
ZW02n0000_p0027a03_##新編修一部漢文大藏經，是非常必要而適時的。新藏名為《金陵大
ZW02n0000_p0027a04_##藏經》，或另行命名如《無盡意藏》亦無不可。如巴利語三藏完成漢
ZW02n0000_p0027a05_##譯，藏漢兩部大藏又完成對勘互譯，則不但完成了中國佛教三大語
ZW02n0000_p0027a06_##系的典藉總集，而且將是世界上最完整的佛教典藉總彙——集人
ZW02n0000_p0027a07_##間法藏之大成。那纔是真正最理想最完備的中華大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0027a08_##<p,0,2>綜合現代各方對修藏的意見，誠為印順法師所說，可概括為四
ZW02n0000_p0027a09_##大要求：一是「求其精要」，這屬「選藏」工作；二是「求其完備」，這屬
ZW02n0000_p0027a10_##「續藏」工作；三是「求其通順易曉」，這屬編譯「語體（白話）文本」工
ZW02n0000_p0027a11_##作；四是「求其傳佈世界」，這屬「將漢藏譯為世界各種語文版本」工
ZW02n0000_p0027a12_##作。後兩種要求是性質不同的另類問題，可不與前兩種要求混淆，
ZW02n0000_p0027a13_##納入重修新藏之列。這樣，編修新藏的要求，主要是兩條：求精與
ZW02n0000_p0027a14_##求備。求精就要選，就要如理；求備就要全，就要如量。二者看似
ZW02n0000_p0027a15_##矛盾，實乃相輔相成。其間就要求編，求編就要法，就要如法，這就
ZW02n0000_p0027a16_##是第三條，也就是在「選藏」、「續藏」的基礎上更深層次地「編藏」。
ZW02n0000_p0027a17_##從當機出發，新編大藏，要突出三大特點：
ZW02n0000_p0027a18_##<p,0,2>一、體例的科學性——就是分門別類，要如理如量，既要契合
ZW02n0000_p0027a19_##佛法的根本教義和歷史傳統，又要當機創新適應現代圖書科學分
ZW02n0000_p0027a20_##類方法和學科分類與代碼的國家標準，使新藏本身就體現出佛法
ZW02n0000_p0027a21_##圓融大小乘，圓融顯密教，圓融世、出世法的圓融性。
ZW02n0000_p0027a22_##<p,0,2>二、收集的完整性——就是完備齊全，要包括漢傳、藏傳、南傳
ZW02n0000_p0027a23_##三個語系的漢文譯著以及日、朝、韓、印、斯、緬、泰等國乃至歐美的
ZW02n0000_p0027a24_##漢文譯著。這就需要譯經工作相與配合。譯經工作有三，即（一）、
ZW02n0000_p0027a25_##譯巴利語三藏為漢；（二）、漢藏大藏經對譯，主要是藏譯漢；（三）、
ZW02n0000_p0027a26_##今譯，即近現代世界佛學名著譯漢。此外還要搜求佚書，收集《房
ZW02n0000_p0027a27_##山石經》、《敦煌寶藏》及藏外佛書，乃至與佛教有重大關聯的非佛
ZW02n0000_p0027a28_##教典籍，收集完整齊備，使新藏本身就體現出佛法具足三藏一味，
ZW02n0000_p0028a01_##九乘差別，具足世法、出世間法的圓滿性。
ZW02n0000_p0028a02_##<p,0,2>三、實用的方便性——就是方便實用，不僅便於供奉、收藏、流
ZW02n0000_p0028a03_##通，而且印刷精美，便於翻閱，切合實用，經濟實惠，使讀者生歡喜
ZW02n0000_p0028a04_##心，恭敬心，得到法益受用。要求標點逗句，提供系統圖像，編好各
ZW02n0000_p0028a05_##種索引，附錄必要資料，包括悉曇、音義、曲譜、年表、曼荼羅、比較
ZW02n0000_p0028a06_##圖、對照目錄等等，宋體紙型編排印刷，製圖、插畫、美編、裝潢等
ZW02n0000_p0028a07_##等，儘可能採用現代化手段。無論是光盤或紙型，但必需保留傳統
ZW02n0000_p0028a08_##優點，發揚金陵刻經處木版線裝的莊嚴美觀的傳統優勢，使新藏本
ZW02n0000_p0028a09_##身就體現佛法方便善巧，出入一切門示現無礙的圓成（用）性。
ZW02n0000_p0028a10_##<p,0,2>要編好這種具有中國特色，能適應現代走向世界，真正能承前
ZW02n0000_p0028a11_##啟後、繼往開來的新編漢文大藏經，關鍵要抓好四個基本點，即做
ZW02n0000_p0028a12_##好四項基本工作：一是定好體例，二是編好目錄，三是選好版本，四
ZW02n0000_p0028a13_##是搞好標點。
ZW02n0000_p0028a14_##<p,0,2>一、定好體例。即首先解決分門別類的部類問題。綜觀歷代
ZW02n0000_p0028a15_##藏目，自《開元錄》立其範疇，至元代慶吉祥作《至元法寶勘同總
ZW02n0000_p0028a16_##錄》，一度變更。《開元》以大小乘各分經律論，《至元》以經律論各
ZW02n0000_p0028a17_##分大小乘；《開元》大小乘經分重單譯，《至元》不分重單譯。《南
ZW02n0000_p0028a18_##藏》、《北藏》、《嘉興》、《龍藏》等遞相倣傚。明寂曉《釋教彙目義
ZW02n0000_p0028a19_##門》，改革部類，合併經律論雜，分為華嚴、阿含、方等，般若、法華、
ZW02n0000_p0028a20_##涅槃、陀羅尼、聖賢著述八部，此就五時說教順序，第四時方等賅括
ZW02n0000_p0028a21_##寶積、大集，第五時則分為法華、涅槃。此乃創新之分類，但後世各
ZW02n0000_p0028a22_##藏均無倣傚者，惟《閱藏知津》及日本《縮刻藏》效其華嚴居首。說
ZW02n0000_p0028a23_##者謂古代各藏以般若居首，般若為諸佛之母，《義門》、《知津》、《縮
ZW02n0000_p0028a24_##刻》以華嚴居首，華嚴為諸經之王。實則華嚴不僅經中之王，亦居
ZW02n0000_p0028a25_##五時之首也。《大正藏》則以阿含居首，取其由淺入深，由小入大之
ZW02n0000_p0028a26_##意。明智旭《閱藏知津》又另起爐灶，別開蹊徑，日本《縮刻》，略仿
ZW02n0000_p0028a27_##《知津》，《大正》亦本《知津》而加變革。就中國言，藏經雖多，所分
ZW02n0000_p0028a28_##部類祇此《開元》、《至元》、《義門》、《知津》四種。日本《縮刻》、《卍
ZW02n0000_p0029a01_##字續》皆具義例，《大正藏》殆集各藏之長，如前所述，還不儘理想。
ZW02n0000_p0029a02_##晚近學者，諍論頗多，見仁見智，各有所得。按古代印度傳譯佛書，
ZW02n0000_p0029a03_##約時代而豎分，不出聲聞藏、菩薩藏、秘密藏三大類；約內容及文體
ZW02n0000_p0029a04_##而橫分，即不出經、律、論、雜四藏。從印度發展到中國三大語系的
ZW02n0000_p0029a05_##佛書，則不能不考慮到密乘與禪宗諸書，勢必要立密藏與禪藏。密
ZW02n0000_p0029a06_##藏亦有先例，意見不大；唯立禪藏，異議頗多。近世紀來，由於佛法
ZW02n0000_p0029a07_##傳入西方以及近代文化的影響，治理佛學方法，多少與古代不同，
ZW02n0000_p0029a08_##使用之語文，研究之論題，更為廣泛，體裁與內容，都與古代有很大
ZW02n0000_p0029a09_##差別。因之近現代著作除可納入經、律、論、密、禪五藏中外，其他
ZW02n0000_p0029a10_##均可攝入雜藏。這樣，就以經、律、論、密、禪、雜六藏來分類，每類
ZW02n0000_p0029a11_##之下再按大小乘法門及世法學科性質分目。其詳將另擬新編漢文
ZW02n0000_p0029a12_##大藏經的體例說明。
ZW02n0000_p0029a13_##<p,0,2>二、編好目錄。即按所定體例分門別類編目。過去上海佛學
ZW02n0000_p0029a14_##書局曾油印有《五種大藏經目錄彙編》、呂澂著有《新編漢文大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0029a15_##目錄》、現在有臺灣出版蔡運辰編著的《二十五種藏經目錄對照考
ZW02n0000_p0029a16_##釋》，甚為詳盡。最近我所又訪得社科院有人編有《近百年來重要
ZW02n0000_p0029a17_##佛書目錄》及《近百年來重要佛學論文目錄》，中國佛教圖文館編有
ZW02n0000_p0029a18_##館藏《藏傳佛教漢譯著作目錄》，成都黃顯銘補足日本宇井伯壽編
ZW02n0000_p0029a19_##的《西藏大藏經總目錄》而撰成的《藏漢對照西藏大藏經目錄》，藏
ZW02n0000_p0029a20_##學研究中心正在編纂《藏漢大藏對勘總目》。這些都為編好新藏提
ZW02n0000_p0029a21_##供了資料條件，我們擬在上述各種目錄以及更加廣泛採集拾遺的
ZW02n0000_p0029a22_##基礎上去粗取精，揚長避短，融會貫通，按新定部類體系，重新編寫
ZW02n0000_p0029a23_##漢文大藏經總目錄。
ZW02n0000_p0029a24_##<p,0,2>三、選好版本。實即解決異本歧出之書的校勘問題。各藏之
ZW02n0000_p0029a25_##有校勘，始於日本《縮刻》而繼以《大正》。因《縮刻》、《大正》皆以
ZW02n0000_p0029a26_##《高麗藏》為本，論者謂《麗藏》錯誤較少，核之殊未盡然。所以行家
ZW02n0000_p0029a27_##大都主張中華修藏，應自擇善本。國家主修的《中華大藏經》頗致
ZW02n0000_p0029a28_##力此，應吸其成果，以免重勞。臺灣學者蔡運辰在其所編著《二十
ZW02n0000_p0030a01_##五種藏經目錄對照考釋跋》中，曾提三項方案，可以參考研究。因
ZW02n0000_p0030a02_##新藏必須標點文句，作好校勘，更為必要。校勘之法，或以一本為
ZW02n0000_p0030a03_##主，分註各本不同之字句，《縮刻》與《大正》皆然。或就各本擇善而
ZW02n0000_p0030a04_##從，而仍註明餘本之不同字句，古藉中頗有此例。或就各本中擇善
ZW02n0000_p0030a05_##而從，不註餘本之不同字句，《頻伽》所校《一切經音義》用此法，論
ZW02n0000_p0030a06_##者謂其未免過於自行，使古書失其真正面目，不宜倣效。凡此均須
ZW02n0000_p0030a07_##研究，慎重而定，萬無一失，裨臻完善。
ZW02n0000_p0030a08_##<p,0,2>四、搞好標點。此即解決經藉斷句問題。由於佛法深奧，一字
ZW02n0000_p0030a09_##多義。佛以一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解。一般標點符號，難以準
ZW02n0000_p0030a10_##確表達句義，甚至造成誤解或障礙。因此對佛經標點，擬採用古藉
ZW02n0000_p0030a11_##逗句辦法，僅用逗號、句號，以示斷句；或用「．」、「。」兩點以示斷句。
ZW02n0000_p0030a12_##以「└」號於兩行底交以示分段。如何是好，均應從長計議，深入研
ZW02n0000_p0030a13_##究。
ZW02n0000_p0030a14_##<p,0,2>做好上述四項基本工作，則編藏工作基本可以完成。這是前
ZW02n0000_p0030a15_##期工程，後期工程即為印藏工作。印刷發行工作雖仍繁重，但有前
ZW02n0000_p0030a16_##期基礎，即可交叉配合進行。其實施方案將由中國佛教文化研究
ZW02n0000_p0030a17_##所與金陵刻經處擬定。
ZW02n0000_p0030a18_##<p,0,2>新編漢文大藏經，是人類文明建設的根本大事，是續佛慧命、
ZW02n0000_p0030a19_##當機弘揚佛法的根本大事。顯實相於文字，轉法輪於經藏，化干戈
ZW02n0000_p0030a20_##為玉帛，挽共業以淨行，誓願精誠，眾生祈求，諸佛加持，人天護佑，
ZW02n0000_p0030a21_##全力以赴，圓滿成就。

ZW02n0000_p0031a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0031a05_##<p,0,2>佛教在印土流行，從公元前六世紀至十二世紀，約有一千八百
ZW02n0000_p0031a06_##年歷史，大致可分三期：初六百年，為原始佛教和部派佛教形成時
ZW02n0000_p0031a07_##期；中六百年，為大乘顯教發展時期；後六百年，為密乘佛教流行時
ZW02n0000_p0031a08_##期。初期佛教以上座、大眾兩部為主，三、四百年中分化為二十個
ZW02n0000_p0031a09_##部派。其中上座部分南北二傳，南傳上座部，在阿育王時期傳入斯
ZW02n0000_p0031a10_##里蘭卡，先後又傳入緬甸、泰國、越南、柬埔寨等地。公元七世紀後
ZW02n0000_p0031a11_##又自緬甸傳入中國雲南，迄今流行於雲南傣族等幾個民族地區，形
ZW02n0000_p0031a12_##成中國巴利語系的上座部佛教。巴利語系的佛教，基本上使用巴
ZW02n0000_p0031a13_##利語原典——巴利語的三藏經典，就是巴利語系的南傳大藏經，其
ZW02n0000_p0031a14_##中一部分譯成了少數民族文字，在傣族各地區成為傣族文化的主
ZW02n0000_p0031a15_##體。印度中期的大乘佛教，主要是龍樹——提婆的中觀系統和無
ZW02n0000_p0031a16_##著——世親的瑜伽系統，於公元二世紀傳入中國漢地，公元七世紀
ZW02n0000_p0031a17_##又自漢地和印度傳入中國西藏。印度中期、後期的佛教，在中國形
ZW02n0000_p0031a18_##成漢語系和藏語系兩大佛教。特別是印度後六百年的密教，包括
ZW02n0000_p0031a19_##早、中、晚三期的密教，從八世紀開始全部傳入中國西藏，一直流傳
ZW02n0000_p0031a20_##至今。現在流傳於中國的三個語系的佛教，是全面地繼承了印度
ZW02n0000_p0031a21_##歷史上的一千八百年分為三期的佛教，而且結合中國實際又大大
ZW02n0000_p0031a22_##地發展了，形成了具有中國特色的佛教。可以說，世界上完整的佛
ZW02n0000_p0031a23_##教和完整的密教都在中國。中國三大語系佛教典藉的總集，便是
ZW02n0000_p0031a24_##南傳大藏經、漢文大藏經和藏文大藏經。這三部總集，不但反映了
ZW02n0000_p0031a25_##印度佛教典藉的全貌，而且彙集了中國佛教典藉的精華。可以說，
ZW02n0000_p0031a26_##世界上完整的佛典也在中國。但不足的是：第一、巴利語三藏大都
ZW02n0000_p0031a27_##沒有譯成漢文；第二、漢藏兩部大藏，沒有對勘補譯；第三、世界佛
ZW02n0000_p0032a01_##學名著，漢譯太少。正因為如此，在中國佛教協會會長趙樸初大德
ZW02n0000_p0032a02_##的領導下，中國佛教文化研究所特列「譯經」一項重要工作，欲以彌
ZW02n0000_p0032a03_##補以上三項之不足，裨三大語系佛典總集，全臻完善。
ZW02n0000_p0032a04_##<p,0,2>巴利三藏，世界上已有十多種文字系統譯本，唯獨漢文譯本至
ZW02n0000_p0032a05_##今僅有零星的單品，這不能不說是我國佛教譯經事業的重大缺陷，
ZW02n0000_p0032a06_##實是一件很大的憾事。古代漢譯諸經中，雖有些典藉與巴利經典
ZW02n0000_p0032a07_##「相當」，如「四阿含」，但並非譯自蘭卡大寺部的巴利語傳本，而是
ZW02n0000_p0032a08_##譯自其他部派的梵本或西域諸語本，所以兩者之間仍有區別。雖
ZW02n0000_p0032a09_##可資比較研究，但不能籠統地直說「某經同於某經」。1943年成立
ZW02n0000_p0032a10_##的「上海普慧大藏經刊印會」本計劃出版北傳、南傳全部經典，但勝
ZW02n0000_p0032a11_##緣未具，南傳巴利三藏祇從日譯轉譯六冊為漢，包括夏丐尊譯的
ZW02n0000_p0032a12_##《小部》二冊在內，共七十三經，一百五十個本生故事及《發趣論》。
ZW02n0000_p0032a13_##在趙樸老的支持下，1981年中國佛協葉均譯出《清淨道論》，1985
ZW02n0000_p0032a14_##年譯出《攝阿毗達磨義論》，並重譯《法句》。1985年郭良鋆、黃寶
ZW02n0000_p0032a15_##生合譯出《佛本生故事選》，1990年，郭良鋆又譯出《經集》，1992
ZW02n0000_p0032a16_##年，鄧殿臣，威馬萊垃擔尼合譯出《長老尼偈》。以上諸譯，數量有
ZW02n0000_p0032a17_##限，未成系統。值得高興的是，在吳老擇先生主持下，臺灣元亨寺
ZW02n0000_p0032a18_##成立「南傳大藏經編譯委員會」，從1988年開始系統地漢譯，據傳
ZW02n0000_p0032a19_##已譯出四十餘卷，但仍係採用日譯本轉譯為漢的辦法。「功成不必
ZW02n0000_p0032a20_##在我」，對於所有從事南傳譯漢工作的個人和組織，我們都讚歎隨
ZW02n0000_p0032a21_##喜，願與合作。
ZW02n0000_p0032a22_##<p,0,2>南傳大藏經系統漢譯的工作起步較晚，困難很多，關鍵在於人
ZW02n0000_p0032a23_##才的培養。有鑒於斯，趙樸老指示中國佛教文化研究所必須把譯
ZW02n0000_p0032a24_##經事業、學術研究和培養人才三者很好結合起來。從三十年代起，
ZW02n0000_p0032a25_##樸老就先後支持三批「五比丘」留學斯里蘭卡，期望南傳大藏系統
ZW02n0000_p0032a26_##漢譯工作及南傳佛教弘化事業在中國有個新的突破和劃時代的發
ZW02n0000_p0032a27_##展。為此，從1992年起，在極端困難條件下，我所開始籌措南傳大
ZW02n0000_p0032a28_##藏的系統漢譯的編譯工作，並取得南京金陵刻經處的大力支持與
ZW02n0000_p0033a01_##合作。我們的編譯主要堅持兩個原則：一個是忠實原典，尊重真
ZW02n0000_p0033a02_##譯，源自巴利，如同巴利。即或是轉譯自日文、英文的也一定要以
ZW02n0000_p0033a03_##巴利語直校，審覈無誤，不能來自傳譯，又復重譯，這就是堅持「信」
ZW02n0000_p0033a04_##的原則。二是譯經如經，通達明白，既非純文，亦不全白，儘力發揚
ZW02n0000_p0033a05_##佛經翻譯的優良傳統，充分顯示文字般若的圓通功能，這就是堅持
ZW02n0000_p0033a06_##「達」與「雅」的原則。合乎這兩條原則的譯著，我們用而編之；不合
ZW02n0000_p0033a07_##乎這兩條原則的，我們則組而譯之。編譯一本，我們就印行一本。

ZW02n0000_p0034a03A##方廣錩
ZW02n0000_p0034a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0034a05_##<p,0,2>大藏經是我國漢文佛教典籍的總彙，它是中外文化交流的結
ZW02n0000_p0034a06_##晶，曾對東方世界產生過深遠的影響。南北朝以來，歷代都把修造
ZW02n0000_p0034a07_##大藏經作為一件重要的事業。以至出現每個朝代都要修正史，每
ZW02n0000_p0034a08_##個朝代都要修大藏經這麼一種人文景觀。當前，在我國，從大文化
ZW02n0000_p0034a09_##角度看待佛教，在承認佛教的宗教性的前提下，充分認識它的文化
ZW02n0000_p0034a10_##品性，從而認真研究與評價它在中國傳統文化中的地位與影響，以
ZW02n0000_p0034a11_##及在新時代社會文化構建中的作用，已經越來越成為人們的共識。
ZW02n0000_p0034a12_##在國際上，越來越多的人認識到，在不同文化體系的背景中成長起
ZW02n0000_p0034a13_##來的東西方各國人民，必須加強相互的交流與理解，必須繼承與發
ZW02n0000_p0034a14_##揚人類傳統文化中一切優秀的成分，以共同創造一個更加美好的
ZW02n0000_p0034a15_##未來。而曾經影響了並至今仍影響著東方世界廣大區域與人民的
ZW02n0000_p0034a16_##佛教，也因此而日益為國際所重視。在世界三大系佛教所保存的
ZW02n0000_p0034a17_##典籍中，漢文大藏經保存的資料數量最多，時間跨度最大，覆蓋的
ZW02n0000_p0034a18_##部派與地區也最廣。所以，巴利語三藏與藏傳甘珠爾、丹珠爾固然
ZW02n0000_p0034a19_##有其不可替代的價值，漢文大藏經則顯然更加值得我們重視。正
ZW02n0000_p0034a20_##因為存在著這樣的社會歷史背景，近幾十年來編輯新的佛教大藏
ZW02n0000_p0034a21_##經的熱潮方興未艾，並向光電化的方向急速發展。這種熱潮將在
ZW02n0000_p0034a22_##一段時間內繼續下去並持續高漲，我們必須予以充分的注意。
ZW02n0000_p0034a23_##<p,0,2>佛教發軔於印度，興盛於中國。尤其以漢文佛典為載體的漢
ZW02n0000_p0034a24_##傳佛教更是在中國孕育成長，發揚光大，並影響東方世界，故世界
ZW02n0000_p0034a25_##稱中國為佛教的第二故鄉。近代以來，世界的佛教研究基本上沿
ZW02n0000_p0034a26_##著梵文佛典、巴利語佛典、藏文佛典的道路前進。由於種種原因，
ZW02n0000_p0034a27_##對梵文佛典、巴利語佛典的整理，我們都落在世界的後面。如果我
ZW02n0000_p0035a01_##們在漢文佛典的整理研究方面再落後於世界，則實在愧對祖先，愧
ZW02n0000_p0035a02_##對「佛教第二故鄉」的稱號。目前日本、韓國、美國等國家以及我國
ZW02n0000_p0035a03_##臺灣地區都比較重視這一事業，將大量人力、物力投入其中。我們
ZW02n0000_p0035a04_##實際上已經處在相對落後的地位。對此必須有清醒的認識。當前
ZW02n0000_p0035a05_##世界已經進入信息社會，在信息社會中，知識產權在社會財富中所
ZW02n0000_p0035a06_##佔的份額將越來越大。大藏經是我們祖先留下的一份知識遺產，
ZW02n0000_p0035a07_##我們不能讓這一份遺產的知識產權喪失在我們這一代人手中。當
ZW02n0000_p0035a08_##然，我們有自己的優勢，如果把這種優勢發揮出來，急起直追，完全
ZW02n0000_p0035a09_##可以在漢文佛教典籍的整理方面做出應有的貢獻。
ZW02n0000_p0035a10_##<p,0,2>當前，討論編纂一部代表當代最高水平的大藏經，可以分解為
ZW02n0000_p0035a11_##如下四個方面：
ZW02n0000_p0035a12_##<p,0,2>第一、有沒有必要編纂這樣的大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0035a13_##<p,0,2>第二、應該編纂一部什麼樣的大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0035a14_##<p,0,2>第三、有沒有可能編纂成這樣一部大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0035a15_##<p,0,2>第四、怎樣來編纂這樣一部大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0035a16_##<p,0,2>下面分別談談。
ZW02n0000_p0035a17_##
ZW02n0000_p0035a18Q3#一
ZW02n0000_p0035a19_##<p,0,2>關於編纂一部高水平、高質量、權威性的大藏經的重要意義及
ZW02n0000_p0035a20_##其必要性，諸位先生已經談了不少。歸納起來大體可以有如下幾
ZW02n0000_p0035a21_##個方面：賡續我國歷史傳統，弘揚民族優秀文化；提高佛教的文化
ZW02n0000_p0035a22_##品位，引導佛教的發展趨向；佔據佛教文化制高點，激勵民族奮發
ZW02n0000_p0035a23_##精神；加強民族交流，促進民族團結；增進中華民族凝聚力，促進祖
ZW02n0000_p0035a24_##國和平統一；打開國門，走向世界，積極參與世界文化交流等等。
ZW02n0000_p0035a25_##對於上述觀點，我都完全贊同。在此想就二個問題談點補充看法：
ZW02n0000_p0035a26_##<p,0,2>一、正確看待佛教在歷史上與現實中的作用
ZW02n0000_p0035a27_##<p,0,2>這個問題看起來與編藏無關，實際上不然。我們現在要編一
ZW02n0000_p0035a28_##部體現當代水平的大藏經，除了需要廣泛動員佛教界、學術界的力
ZW02n0000_p0036a01_##量之外，還需要社會各界的理解與支持。但現在社會上，甚至包括
ZW02n0000_p0036a02_##佛教界、研究界的某些人對佛教在歷史上與現實中的作用未必都
ZW02n0000_p0036a03_##有統一與正確的認識。因此，有必要加以探討與宣傳。
ZW02n0000_p0036a04_##<p,0,2>我認為，對佛教在歷史上與現實中的作用，必須客觀地、全面
ZW02n0000_p0036a05_##地、歷史地、科學地予以評價。佛教是一種宗教，既然是宗教，必然
ZW02n0000_p0036a06_##有其負面的社會作用。但是，對佛教在不同時代、不同地區、不同
ZW02n0000_p0036a07_##階級的人群中的實際社會作用，以及對這種社會作用的科學評判，
ZW02n0000_p0036a08_##必須用歷史的眼光，作實事求是的具體的分析。我認為，佛教的社
ZW02n0000_p0036a09_##會作用應時空與社會條件的變化而變化。有時是負面的、消極的；
ZW02n0000_p0036a10_##也有時是正面的、積極的。兩者都不可抹殺，也不能用一方面去否
ZW02n0000_p0036a11_##定另一方面。
ZW02n0000_p0036a12_##<p,0,2>另外，我們必須看到，佛教不僅僅是一種巨大的宗教存在，也
ZW02n0000_p0036a13_##是一個不可忽視的巨大的文化存在，對中國傳統文化的各個方面
ZW02n0000_p0036a14_##都有深刻的影響。當然，佛教文化對中國傳統文化的具體影響，也
ZW02n0000_p0036a15_##必須一分為二地進行實事求是的分析。既不可因其消極方面掩蓋
ZW02n0000_p0036a16_##其積極方面，也不可因其積極方面忽視其消極方面。但應該指出
ZW02n0000_p0036a17_##的是，如果說在宗教層面上，佛教的消極面要大於它的積極面的
ZW02n0000_p0036a18_##話；則在文化層面上，佛教的積極面要大於它的消極面。
ZW02n0000_p0036a19_##<p,0,2>當前我們正在建設的社會主義精神文明，不是憑空架構的樓
ZW02n0000_p0036a20_##閣，必然是在對傳統文化進行全面揚棄的過程中產生，其中就包括
ZW02n0000_p0036a21_##佛教文化。因此，繼承佛教文化的優秀部分是弘揚中華民族優秀
ZW02n0000_p0036a22_##傳統文化之必須，是今天建設社會主義新文化之必須。而編輯新
ZW02n0000_p0036a23_##的大藏經則是其中極其重要的一個方面。我想，就歷史經驗而言，
ZW02n0000_p0036a24_##在我們這樣一個社會主義國家中，如果社會各界能夠就上述問題
ZW02n0000_p0036a25_##達成共識，則無論對我們正在討論的大藏經編纂，還是對佛教的健
ZW02n0000_p0036a26_##康發展，都有重大意義。
ZW02n0000_p0036a27_##<p,0,2>二、正確看待大藏經文化
ZW02n0000_p0036a28_##<p,0,2>思想主要靠典籍來傳述。正因為有了典籍，思想的傳播纔能
ZW02n0000_p0037a01_##超越時間與空間。佛教於兩漢之際傳入中國，在兩千年漫長歲月
ZW02n0000_p0037a02_##裡，佛教已經融化在中華民族傳統文化的血液中，成為與儒、道鼎
ZW02n0000_p0037a03_##足而三的不可分割的有機組成部分。大藏經就是中國佛教世代精
ZW02n0000_p0037a04_##華的積累。南北朝以來，歷代都把編纂大藏經作為弘揚文治的一
ZW02n0000_p0037a05_##個重要內容，每個朝代都有官修或準官修的大藏經，不少朝代還編
ZW02n0000_p0037a06_##纂了多部。編修大藏經已經與歷代都要修正史一樣，成為具有充
ZW02n0000_p0037a07_##分文明自覺的中華民族的一個歷史傳統，這在世界四大文明古國
ZW02n0000_p0037a08_##中是獨一無二的。
ZW02n0000_p0037a09_##<p,0,2>但是，與意識形態中儒釋道三家鼎立的格局相適應，我國古代
ZW02n0000_p0037a10_##以儒家為主導的學統及建立在這一學統基礎上的傳統圖書庋藏制
ZW02n0000_p0037a11_##度卻把大藏經排除在外。儒家設計的經史子集四部書體例，雖然
ZW02n0000_p0037a12_##作為與其他諸子百家並列之一家，在「子部」中設立了一個「釋家
ZW02n0000_p0037a13_##類」，但所收均為中國人的佛教著作，絕對不收大藏經。在正統儒
ZW02n0000_p0037a14_##家眼中，佛教作為異端，與小說、戲劇等「小道」一起受到排斥。
ZW02n0000_p0037a15_##1900年敦煌藏經洞被發現以後，發現者王圓籙立即向縣衙門作了
ZW02n0000_p0037a16_##彙報。但主事者所以把這批文物又交由王道士自行保管，重要原
ZW02n0000_p0037a17_##因之一在於它們主要是一批佛教典籍，所以不被這些由儒家科舉
ZW02n0000_p0037a18_##制度出身的官僚們所重視。近代以來雖然有梁啟超、王重民、姚名
ZW02n0000_p0037a19_##達等有識之士的重視，但上述那種傳統的觀念並沒有得到根本的
ZW02n0000_p0037a20_##改變。以至直到現在，不少目錄學家一講目錄學，就是傳統的四部
ZW02n0000_p0037a21_##書目錄學，不知道唐代佛教目錄學的水平遠遠超出同時代的四部
ZW02n0000_p0037a22_##書目錄學。一講善本書就講經史子集的宋元版如何珍貴又如何稀
ZW02n0000_p0037a23_##有，而不重視同一時代的宋元版大藏經。不少圖書館收藏著整部
ZW02n0000_p0037a24_##大藏經、大藏經零本以及許多其他佛教典籍，但長期任其堆置，無
ZW02n0000_p0037a25_##人整理與編目。因此，現在我們有必要在講清佛教文化是中華民
ZW02n0000_p0037a26_##族文化有機組成部分的同時，講清大藏經與其他佛教典籍也是中
ZW02n0000_p0037a27_##華民族文化的重要載體。大藏經固然屬於宗教著作，但內容並不
ZW02n0000_p0037a28_##局限於宗教，還涉及哲學、歷史、語言、文學、藝術、音韻、天文、地
ZW02n0000_p0038a01_##理、曆算、醫學、建築、繪畫、科技、民族、社會、中外關係等諸多領
ZW02n0000_p0038a02_##域。因此，它不但是我們研究佛教的重要資料，也是我們研究中國
ZW02n0000_p0038a03_##文化、東方文化不可或缺的資料。在世界日益縮小，交流日益擴
ZW02n0000_p0038a04_##大，人們正在研究如何構築世界新文化的今天，它將成為中國人貢
ZW02n0000_p0038a05_##獻給世界文化的一份瑰寶。因此，作為一個中國人，我們有責任愛
ZW02n0000_p0038a06_##護它、宣傳它，為它的進一步完善與發展而貢獻力量。
ZW02n0000_p0038a07_##
ZW02n0000_p0038a08Q3#二
ZW02n0000_p0038a09_##<p,0,2>編纂一部什麼樣的大藏經？首先是指導思想，其次是編纂標
ZW02n0000_p0038a10_##準。
ZW02n0000_p0038a11_##<p,0,2>先談談指導思想。
ZW02n0000_p0038a12_##<p,0,2>本世紀以來出現過兩次編纂大藏經的高潮，第二次高潮目前
ZW02n0000_p0038a13_##正方興未艾。參考國際、國內已經編成、正在編纂以及將要投入編
ZW02n0000_p0038a14_##纂的各種大藏經，展望未來世界的發展潮流，我們應該編纂一部什
ZW02n0000_p0038a15_##麼樣的藏經呢？
ZW02n0000_p0038a16_##<p,0,2>在這裡，國家「863計劃」對我們可能有一定的啟發。
ZW02n0000_p0038a17_##<p,0,2>「863計劃」討論科研立項時，有這麼幾條基本原則：國外已經
ZW02n0000_p0038a18_##有，而我們又能夠進口的項目，不搞；國外已經有，但對我們封鎖的
ZW02n0000_p0038a19_##項目，要搞；國外還沒有，我們搞了就有知識產權的，要拚命搞。
ZW02n0000_p0038a20_##<p,0,2>也就是說，如果我們要編纂大藏經，就要樹立高標準，要出新，
ZW02n0000_p0038a21_##要編纂出世界第一流的，有權威性的，在佛教歷史上將佔據制高點
ZW02n0000_p0038a22_##的大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0038a23_##<p,0,2>古今中外編纂的大藏經，總數在四十部以上，我們現在已經掌
ZW02n0000_p0038a24_##握實物的，也有三十多部。我們在這世紀之交編纂的大藏經，應該
ZW02n0000_p0038a25_##是集中這三十多部大藏經的優點於一身，而又有所創新，有所前
ZW02n0000_p0038a26_##進，真正反映二十世紀的最高水平，而又能起到開創二十一世紀佛
ZW02n0000_p0038a27_##教研究新局面的作用。
ZW02n0000_p0038a28_##<p,0,2>總之，我們的指導思想應該是：編纂出一部繼承歷代藏經的優
ZW02n0000_p0039a01_##秀傳統，體現當代佛教文獻學的最高水平，對接未來世界發展大勢
ZW02n0000_p0039a02_##的最有權威性的大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0039a03_##<p,0,2>其次談談藏經標準。
ZW02n0000_p0039a04_##<p,0,2>什麼樣的大藏經纔能夠體現上述指導思想呢？
ZW02n0000_p0039a05_##<p,0,2>我曾經提出「藏經三要素」這一觀點[01]，按照這個觀點，一部優
ZW02n0000_p0039a06_##秀的大藏經應該達到如下三個標準：資料齊全、編排科學、使用方
ZW02n0000_p0039a07_##便。新編的大藏經也應該符合這個標準。
ZW02n0000_p0039a08_##<p,0,2>一、資料齊全
ZW02n0000_p0039a09_##<p,0,2>大藏經本是漢文佛教資料的總彙。所以，所謂資料齊全，原則
ZW02n0000_p0039a10_##上應該把古今中外所有的漢文佛教資料都收集起來，納入新編的
ZW02n0000_p0039a11_##大藏經中。
ZW02n0000_p0039a12_##<p,0,2>我國早期的大藏經有各種形態，入藏標準互有不同。如果研
ZW02n0000_p0039a13_##究一下標準的演變，可以看出有明暗兩條線。從明線說，翻譯典籍
ZW02n0000_p0039a14_##具備必然入選的資格，而中華撰著則祇有候選資格。亦即早期大
ZW02n0000_p0039a15_##藏經基本上祇收域外翻譯典籍，有的藏經酌收若干中華佛教撰著。
ZW02n0000_p0039a16_##但一般來講，祇有史傳、音義、目錄、感應興敬等毗贊佛教有功的中
ZW02n0000_p0039a17_##華佛教撰著纔有候選資格，予以入藏。在這裡，《開元釋教錄．入藏
ZW02n0000_p0039a18_##錄》是最典型的例子。然而，標準的具體掌握與寬嚴總隨著人們觀
ZW02n0000_p0039a19_##念的變化，並應時代、應國家、應編纂者之不同而異。由此，又出現
ZW02n0000_p0039a20_##一條暗線，亦即對中華佛教撰著的入藏標準不斷在放寬，並不僅僅
ZW02n0000_p0039a21_##局限在「毗贊有功」四個字上，以至凡屬與佛教有關的著作幾乎都
ZW02n0000_p0039a22_##有入藏的資格，從而使越來越多的中華佛教撰著被收歸入藏。這
ZW02n0000_p0039a23_##其實也說明後人對大藏經的理論有了發展。這一條暗線，在《高麗
ZW02n0000_p0039a24_##續藏》、明《嘉興續藏》、《又續藏》及日本《卍字續藏》中體現得越來
ZW02n0000_p0039a25_##越清楚。不過，由於種種原因，中華撰著的入藏往往帶有一定的隨
ZW02n0000_p0040a01_##意性，缺乏全面的規劃與嚴格的審訂。
ZW02n0000_p0040a02_##<p,0,2>我們現在編纂大藏經，到底是遵循上述明線標準還是暗線標
ZW02n0000_p0040a03_##準？
ZW02n0000_p0040a04_##<p,0,2>如果採用明線標準。那麼新編的大藏經可以僅收歷代正、續
ZW02n0000_p0040a05_##諸藏中的翻譯佛典以及古逸與近現代新譯佛典，對大藏內外的中
ZW02n0000_p0040a06_##華佛教撰著，則予以嚴格的篩選，祇收那些所謂「毗贊有功」的少量
ZW02n0000_p0040a07_##典籍。但這樣編纂出來的大藏經不可能體現前述指導思想與達到
ZW02n0000_p0040a08_##佔據佛教文獻學高峰的目的。因為按照這種方式編藏，其主體部
ZW02n0000_p0040a09_##分實際上祇是把歷代大藏經已經反覆刊印過的資料重新整理收
ZW02n0000_p0040a10_##納，炒炒冷飯而已。此外，我們說大藏經是中國佛教精華之積累，
ZW02n0000_p0040a11_##是研究中國佛教的重要資料，就在於其中保存了大批中華佛教撰
ZW02n0000_p0040a12_##著。如果按照上述明線標準，則大藏經實際上成了印度佛教、西域
ZW02n0000_p0040a13_##佛教的研究資料，而不主要是中國佛教的資料了。智昇等僧人設
ZW02n0000_p0040a14_##立的編纂大藏經的這一明線標準，在古代就受到佛教有識之士的
ZW02n0000_p0040a15_##批評，今天自然更不能成為我們遵循的依據。
ZW02n0000_p0040a16_##<p,0,2>如果順應潮流，按照今人的「大文化」與「大資料」的觀點辦事，
ZW02n0000_p0040a17_##則應該採採用暗線標準。亦即所有與佛教有關的漢文資料，不管是
ZW02n0000_p0040a18_##古人的，還是今人的，原則上統統應該收入。也就是說，除了歷代
ZW02n0000_p0040a19_##正藏、續藏外，應該把近年新譯、歷代另本、敦煌古逸、金石文獻、房
ZW02n0000_p0040a20_##山石經、叢書類書、個人文集、地方史誌、歷代史籍、今人著述等等
ZW02n0000_p0040a21_##所包含的佛教資料全部新編入藏。如果能夠做到這一點，我們的
ZW02n0000_p0040a22_##大藏經將是空前的資料最完整的佛教大叢書，必然佔據當代佛教
ZW02n0000_p0040a23_##大藏經的最高峰，並為開創未來奠定基礎。
ZW02n0000_p0040a24_##<p,0,2>我認為，討論入藏標準的關鍵在於我們如何認識大藏經的功
ZW02n0000_p0040a25_##能形態。在古代，與中國佛教存在著義理性佛教與信仰性佛教相
ZW02n0000_p0040a26_##適應，大藏經的功能形態也可以分為兩種——義理型大藏經與信
ZW02n0000_p0040a27_##仰型大藏經。兩者固然互為依存，但前者的主要目的是保存、研究
ZW02n0000_p0040a28_##與弘揚佛教，故把有價值（價值觀念各不相同）的典籍收集起來編
ZW02n0000_p0041a01_##纂為藏；後者的主要目的是作為法寶供養，所以有講究外觀的華貴
ZW02n0000_p0041a02_##整齊而忽略內容的傾向[01]。我們現在怎麼看待大藏經呢？
ZW02n0000_p0041a03_##<p,0,2>前幾天與樓宇烈先生交談，樓先生談到，大藏經的一大作用是
ZW02n0000_p0041a04_##資料備查。我完全同意這個觀點。也就是說，是否可以在傳統的
ZW02n0000_p0041a05_##兩大功能之外，給大藏經增加一個新的功能形態——備查型。大
ZW02n0000_p0041a06_##藏經就是一個關於佛教資料的圖書館，它的任務就是提供資料。
ZW02n0000_p0041a07_##圖書館買書，有的書可能十年、八年沒有人借，但這樣的書還是要
ZW02n0000_p0041a08_##買，還是要藏。也許若干年後，這本書會被某個人看中，起到作用。
ZW02n0000_p0041a09_##同樣，大藏經也應該把關於佛教的資料儘量收齊，以供有關人員查
ZW02n0000_p0041a10_##閱。衡量一個圖書館，藏書的多少是最基本的參數。同樣，衡量一
ZW02n0000_p0041a11_##部大藏經，入藏資料的多少也是最重要的標準。把這種備查型大
ZW02n0000_p0041a12_##藏經編纂得儘量科學、合理、便於使用，它也就具備了義理型大藏
ZW02n0000_p0041a13_##經的功能；這種備查型大藏經由於本身資料齊全，可稱是具足了釋
ZW02n0000_p0041a14_##迦如來的八萬四千法藏，自然也就具備了信仰型大藏經的功能。
ZW02n0000_p0041a15_##<p,0,2>上面是從理論的角度談理想的大藏經應該資料齊全，集義理
ZW02n0000_p0041a16_##型、信仰型、備查型三種功能於一身。從現實的角度講，我們想要
ZW02n0000_p0041a17_##讓自己編纂的大藏經在已有與將有的各種藏經中脫穎而出，具有
ZW02n0000_p0041a18_##權威性，不僅在現在、而且在將來的一段時期之內都能夠佔據佛教
ZW02n0000_p0041a19_##文獻學的制高點，就必須在入藏典籍方面超過前此所有的大藏經，
ZW02n0000_p0041a20_##要力求把與佛教有關的資料一網打盡，包容無遺。道理很簡單，對
ZW02n0000_p0041a21_##於一個研究李白的人來講，《太白全集》與《太白選集》，究竟哪一種
ZW02n0000_p0041a22_##更有價值呢？答案是不言自明的。當然，真正的一網打盡，祇是一
ZW02n0000_p0041a23_##種理想，在實踐中極難實現。但我們應該向這個方向努力。「取法
ZW02n0000_p0041a24_##於上，得之於中；取法於中，得之於下。」我們必須高標準，嚴要求，
ZW02n0000_p0041a25_##必須要求儘量做到把有關資料收集齊全，越多越好。
ZW02n0000_p0042a01_##<p,0,2>這裡還必須突出提一下新編入藏問題。
ZW02n0000_p0042a02_##<p,0,2>我們講資料齊全，一層意思是指要把歷代藏經已經收入的典
ZW02n0000_p0042a03_##籍收歸入藏，不要遺漏。這一點比較容易做到。由於歷代編藏者
ZW02n0000_p0042a04_##的努力，這些資料已經被收集彙攏起來，就好比礦石已經被煉成鋼
ZW02n0000_p0042a05_##鐵。祇是有的是精鋼，現成就可以利用；有的是粗鐵，還需要我們
ZW02n0000_p0042a06_##加工而已。資料齊全的另一層意思則是我們要把應該入藏而歷代
ZW02n0000_p0042a07_##大藏沒有收入的資料也統統收歸入藏。這就是要我們自己去找
ZW02n0000_p0042a08_##礦、開礦、煉鋼。據我粗略估計，現存辛亥革命以前的有關佛教資
ZW02n0000_p0042a09_##料總數大約在3.5億字左右，其中已經收入歷代大藏經（包括日本
ZW02n0000_p0042a10_##《卍字續藏》）的大約為2.5億字，即還有1億字左右的資料需要我
ZW02n0000_p0042a11_##們去收集整理。辛亥革命至今的資料總數大約也不會少於1億
ZW02n0000_p0042a12_##字。現在我們編纂大藏經，如果祇局限在已經入藏的2.5億字這
ZW02n0000_p0042a13_##個圈子中炒冷飯，則不如不編。祇有把眼光放寬到另外的2億字
ZW02n0000_p0042a14_##上，纔能突出我們的特色，佔據歷史的高峰，真正編纂出無愧於我
ZW02n0000_p0042a15_##們時代的大藏經。也就是說，現在編藏，必須在新編入藏方面下大
ZW02n0000_p0042a16_##功夫，做大文章。
ZW02n0000_p0042a17_##<p,0,2>這裡還有四個問題需要討論：
ZW02n0000_p0042a18_##<p,0,2>第一、編藏下限問題
ZW02n0000_p0042a19_##<p,0,2>關於這個問題，學者們有種種不同的意見。有的主張截止到
ZW02n0000_p0042a20_##清末，有的主張截止到1949年中華人民共和國成立。我認為上述
ZW02n0000_p0042a21_##主張從理論上講不符合我國歷代編藏傳統；從實踐上講必然把一
ZW02n0000_p0042a22_##大批應該入藏的典籍摒棄到大藏經之外。因此都不可取。
ZW02n0000_p0042a23_##<p,0,2>前面提到，我國有編寫正史與編寫大藏經兩大人文傳統。古
ZW02n0000_p0042a24_##代編寫正史，其下限的確都截止到舊王朝覆滅，新王朝誕生。但歷
ZW02n0000_p0042a25_##代編纂大藏經，其下限都截止到編藏當時。今天我們編纂大藏經，
ZW02n0000_p0042a26_##當然應該遵循這個代代相傳的編藏傳統。此外，中華民國時期乃
ZW02n0000_p0042a27_##至中華人民共和國成立以來，新的佛教典籍不斷湧現，其中既有歷
ZW02n0000_p0042a28_##代散逸，也有現代新譯，更有今人著作。這些佛教典籍，開創了我
ZW02n0000_p0043a01_##國佛教發展與佛教研究的新時代。我們新編的大藏經，理應反映
ZW02n0000_p0043a02_##這些新成果。長江後浪推前浪，這是事物發展的規律；不薄古人愛
ZW02n0000_p0043a03_##今人，也應該成為我們編纂大藏經的基本原則。祇有容納這些近
ZW02n0000_p0043a04_##代以來的最新資料與最新成果，纔能體現時代特色，體現學術水
ZW02n0000_p0043a05_##平。
ZW02n0000_p0043a06_##<p,0,2>當然，主張把下限截止到清末或1949年的觀點也有其道理。
ZW02n0000_p0043a07_##主要是近現代的佛教著作太多，收不勝收。加之上乘者少，平庸者
ZW02n0000_p0043a08_##多。甚至有不少錯誤百出之作，完全沒有入藏的資格。而我們今
ZW02n0000_p0043a09_##天的人力、物力都很有限，根本不可能把這些資料全部收羅入藏。
ZW02n0000_p0043a10_##即使收羅進來，也是徒耗資財，毫無價值。
ZW02n0000_p0043a11_##<p,0,2>這是一個值得重視的意見。我認為，平庸的著作乃至錯誤百
ZW02n0000_p0043a12_##出的著作也反映了一個時代學術面貌的某一側面。例如當前社會
ZW02n0000_p0043a13_##急速向市場經濟導進，在佛教研究界則表現為部分人學風浮躁，著
ZW02n0000_p0043a14_##作粗糙。甚至在經濟利益的驅動下，某些不懂佛教的人也敢動手
ZW02n0000_p0043a15_##編寫佛教的書籍。從這個意義上講，上述著作反映了特定社會條
ZW02n0000_p0043a16_##件下的特定社會文化的現實情況，也有其特定的研究價值。但我
ZW02n0000_p0043a17_##們畢竟不可能，也沒有必要把這些著作統統收入到大藏經中。因
ZW02n0000_p0043a18_##此，對於現有的各種佛教著作，就產生一個選擇取捨問題。
ZW02n0000_p0043a19_##<p,0,2>一方面希望大藏經所收資料儘量齊全，最好能夠將有關的佛
ZW02n0000_p0043a20_##教資料一網打盡；另一方面由於人力財力有限，必須對現有資料進
ZW02n0000_p0043a21_##行取捨選擇。這是一個矛盾。如何處理好這個矛盾？關鍵在於掌
ZW02n0000_p0043a22_##握好取捨的標準，也就是掌握好「度」。
ZW02n0000_p0043a23_##<p,0,2>講到取捨標準，就必須兼顧歷史編藏的傳統。如前所述，古代
ZW02n0000_p0043a24_##編藏，凡屬根據西域引進原本翻譯的佛教典籍（包括少量與佛教相
ZW02n0000_p0043a25_##關的外道典籍）一律入藏。而對中華佛教撰著則依不同標準予以
ZW02n0000_p0043a26_##取捨。我認為，這一標準對我們今天編纂大藏經依舊適用。也就
ZW02n0000_p0043a27_##是說，我們現在所謂的取捨標準，主要是對中華佛教撰著而言。由
ZW02n0000_p0043a28_##於部分古代中華佛教撰著已經入藏，而按照傳統與慣例，這些典籍
ZW02n0000_p0044a01_##應該照舊編入新的大藏經，所以問題實際又歸結為對現存的古今
ZW02n0000_p0044a02_##未入藏佛教典籍，應如何確立其入藏標準。亦即應如何確立對中
ZW02n0000_p0044a03_##華佛教撰著新編入藏的標準。
ZW02n0000_p0044a04_##<p,0,2>我認為，從理論上講，是否可以按照如下原則確立新編入藏的
ZW02n0000_p0044a05_##標準：亦即凡屬有新觀點、或有新資料、或採用了新的論證方法的
ZW02n0000_p0044a06_##著作，都必然對佛教研究有所貢獻，從而都應有入藏的資格。在這
ZW02n0000_p0044a07_##裡，對所謂「新觀點」，應當尺度從寬。亦即有些觀點，即使現在看
ZW02n0000_p0044a08_##來論據不足，似乎不那麼能夠站得住腳，但祇要它發前人之未發，
ZW02n0000_p0044a09_##我們就應該允許它存在。一個時代有一個時代的價值體系，但每
ZW02n0000_p0044a10_##個時代都會出現一些超越本時代價值體系的新觀點。如果我們在
ZW02n0000_p0044a11_##編藏時採取緊縮政策，則一些優秀的觀點就可能被緊縮掉，從而湮
ZW02n0000_p0044a12_##沒掉。如果我們採取適度從寬的政策，把它們保留下來，則這些觀
ZW02n0000_p0044a13_##點可能會在將來的某個時候大放光彩。
ZW02n0000_p0044a14_##<p,0,2>確立了上述理論原則後，在具體的編藏實際中，如何正確地、
ZW02n0000_p0044a15_##全面地、適當掌握上述原則，仍然是一個需要在實踐中認真處理的
ZW02n0000_p0044a16_##問題。我想，有兩點是應該注意的。
ZW02n0000_p0044a17_##<p,0,2>首先，標準的掌握，應該有科學的、實事求是的態度。在此，我
ZW02n0000_p0044a18_##們必須吸取古代編藏僧人的教訓。如唐智昇所編《開元釋教錄．入
ZW02n0000_p0044a19_##藏錄》，從來被視作編纂大藏經的典範。但該《入藏錄》對中華佛教
ZW02n0000_p0044a20_##撰著挑剔極嚴，除了少量因「毗贊佛教有功」被智昇收入大藏經外，
ZW02n0000_p0044a21_##絕大多數典籍，包括中國佛教各宗各派闡述自己宗義的重要著作，
ZW02n0000_p0044a22_##統統被排斥在藏外，任其自生自滅，不少著作因而湮沒無聞。這是
ZW02n0000_p0044a23_##中國佛教的重大損失，智昇無從辭其咎。今天我們編纂大藏經，要
ZW02n0000_p0044a24_##把應該收入的典籍全部收入，給後人多留一些資料。而不要採取
ZW02n0000_p0044a25_##智昇那樣的態度，讓後人再來批評我們。
ZW02n0000_p0044a26_##<p,0,2>其次，「標準」也者，應該是客觀的。因此，我們不能以編藏者
ZW02n0000_p0044a27_##本人的好惡來衡量一部著作能否入藏。當年編纂《四庫全書》，館
ZW02n0000_p0044a28_##臣們按照滿清封建王朝的標準，把一大批著作剔除在外，以致今天
ZW02n0000_p0045a01_##人們需要重編《四庫存目叢書》，而《存目》中的不少書籍現在已經
ZW02n0000_p0045a02_##亡佚無存，不能不使人感到遺憾。今天我們編輯大藏經，不應該再
ZW02n0000_p0045a03_##使後人產生類似的遺憾。
ZW02n0000_p0045a04_##<p,0,2>前面談到，平庸乃至錯誤百出的著作也有其特定的價值，但我
ZW02n0000_p0045a05_##們又不可能把它們收入大藏。那麼，如何處理這些書籍呢？我以
ZW02n0000_p0045a06_##為可以用編纂目錄與撰寫提要的方式保留它們的概貌。亦即凡是
ZW02n0000_p0045a07_##沒有收歸入藏的著作，一律以目錄與提要的形式予以著錄與反映。
ZW02n0000_p0045a08_##後人可以根據目錄與提要瞭解它們並進行研究。這種目錄與提要
ZW02n0000_p0045a09_##的另一個作用則是對我們工作中可能產生的疏漏的一種補救措
ZW02n0000_p0045a10_##施。因為我們雖然計劃把一切有價值的資料一網打盡，但這祇是
ZW02n0000_p0045a11_##一種理想。在實際編藏工作中是否能夠完全實現這一理想，還需
ZW02n0000_p0045a12_##要打一個問號。我們祇能儘量去做而已。所以，如果能夠把所有
ZW02n0000_p0045a13_##不入藏的資料全部以目錄與提要的形式予以反映，則等於設立了
ZW02n0000_p0045a14_##一條後衛防線。如果我們有疏漏，後人可以依據這個目錄與提要，
ZW02n0000_p0045a15_##尋找他們需要的資料。
ZW02n0000_p0045a16_##<p,0,2>第二、國外漢文佛典問題
ZW02n0000_p0045a17_##<p,0,2>眾所周知，漢傳佛教遍佈於漢字文化圈。地域包括日本、朝
ZW02n0000_p0045a18_##鮮、越南。這些國家古代都使用漢字，當時這些國家的僧人所撰寫
ZW02n0000_p0045a19_##的佛教著作也都屬於漢文佛教撰著。那麼，新編的佛教大藏經是
ZW02n0000_p0045a20_##否應該把這些著作也收羅進來呢？
ZW02n0000_p0045a21_##<p,0,2>這裡實際又涉及這樣一個理論問題：我們說，佛教從印度傳入
ZW02n0000_p0045a22_##中國，與中國傳統文化相結合，在新的條件下醞釀發展為中國佛
ZW02n0000_p0045a23_##教，從而使中國成為佛教的第二故鄉。這就是說，中國佛教雖然以
ZW02n0000_p0045a24_##印度佛教為源，雖然與印度佛教同屬佛教文化圈，但它實際上已經
ZW02n0000_p0045a25_##卓然獨立，成為與印度佛教有著許多顯著不同特點的新的派別。
ZW02n0000_p0045a26_##那麼，中國佛教傳播到朝鮮、日本、越南等東亞各國，共同形成漢傳
ZW02n0000_p0045a27_##佛教圈之後，朝鮮、日本與越南的佛教與中國本土佛教到底是什麼
ZW02n0000_p0045a28_##關係？是雖然流傳區域不同，但在理論與實踐上並無什麼實質性
ZW02n0000_p0046a01_##的差異？還是已經獨立成為與中國本土佛教具有不同性質的朝鮮
ZW02n0000_p0046a02_##佛教、日本佛教與越南佛教，成為漢傳佛教圈中新的支派？如果說
ZW02n0000_p0046a03_##上述三國的佛教與中國本土佛教沒有質的區別，則上述三國古代
ZW02n0000_p0046a04_##僧人的佛教著作自然應該是研究中國佛教的重要資料之一。如果
ZW02n0000_p0046a05_##說上述三國的佛教也已經卓然獨立，則三國僧人的著作更主要的
ZW02n0000_p0046a06_##反映了本國佛教的情況。這是一個需要認真研究的問題。當然，
ZW02n0000_p0046a07_##我在上面如此提出問題本身，就已經把一個複雜的問題簡單化了。
ZW02n0000_p0046a08_##實際上，佛教中國化有一個過程。如果說存在著佛教朝鮮化、日本
ZW02n0000_p0046a09_##化、越南化的話，必然也有一個過程。因此，不能簡單地以國別為
ZW02n0000_p0046a10_##標準來區分這些著作對中國佛教研究的價值。
ZW02n0000_p0046a11_##<p,0,2>我主張上述三國的佛教仍然屬於漢傳佛教圈，但也必須看到
ZW02n0000_p0046a12_##佛教傳入上述三國後，與各有關國家的具體條件相結合，產生一些
ZW02n0000_p0046a13_##不同於中國本土佛教的新特點，成為漢傳佛教圈中的新派別，因
ZW02n0000_p0046a14_##此，上述三國僧人的佛教著作可以分成多種情況。有的是由來華
ZW02n0000_p0046a15_##的留學僧寫的。這些留學僧中的不少人長期居留中國，有的甚至
ZW02n0000_p0046a16_##終生不歸，如玄奘門下的圓測等。他們對中國佛教的發展也做出
ZW02n0000_p0046a17_##了貢獻，他們的著作理所當然屬於中國佛教的範疇。有的是由短
ZW02n0000_p0046a18_##期在中國留學的僧人撰寫的關於中國佛教的著作，如日本圓仁的
ZW02n0000_p0046a19_##《入唐求法巡禮行記》等，是我們研究中國佛教不可或缺的重要資
ZW02n0000_p0046a20_##料。有的是由親鸞這樣僧人完全依據本國的實際情況編纂成的佛
ZW02n0000_p0046a21_##教著作，這一類著作基本上應算作研究該國佛教的資料。也有的
ZW02n0000_p0046a22_##如新羅元曉，他的著作既參與中國佛教對若干佛學問題的討論，又
ZW02n0000_p0046a23_##是研究新羅佛教的寶貴資料。總的來說可以分為兩大類，一類與
ZW02n0000_p0046a24_##中國本土的佛教有關，一類與中國本土的佛教基本無關。但世界
ZW02n0000_p0046a25_##上的事情是複雜的，不少問題往往很難截然分開或判斷其性質。
ZW02n0000_p0046a26_##<p,0,2>由此，我認為對古代外國僧人的漢文佛教著作，應該區別情況
ZW02n0000_p0046a27_##對待之。對與中國本土佛教有關的著作，毫無疑問應當收歸新編
ZW02n0000_p0046a28_##的大藏經。對於性質一時難辨的，也不妨收歸入藏。至於明確與
ZW02n0000_p0047a01_##中國本土佛教無關的，祇要人力、物力諸方面許可，也應該收入。
ZW02n0000_p0047a02_##我們中華民族本來就有這種兼蓄博收的廣大胸懷，現在應該更加
ZW02n0000_p0047a03_##發揚光大。即使一時條件有限，暫緩入藏，最終也應該把它們收進
ZW02n0000_p0047a04_##來。
ZW02n0000_p0047a05_##<p,0,2>第三、梵巴藏佛典及近代佛教著作的翻譯問題
ZW02n0000_p0047a06_##<p,0,2>大而言之，佛教可以分為印度佛教、南傳佛教、漢傳佛教與藏
ZW02n0000_p0047a07_##傳佛教。所傳承的分別是梵文（包括各種印度俗語）典籍、巴利語
ZW02n0000_p0047a08_##三藏、漢文大藏經、藏文甘珠兒與丹珠兒。與印度佛教已經衰亡相
ZW02n0000_p0047a09_##應，梵文典籍也已經雲散，目前僅有少量尚存。其他三大語系的佛
ZW02n0000_p0047a10_##教流傳至今，其典籍也保存完整。在此值得一提的是我國是世界
ZW02n0000_p0047a11_##上惟一的三大語系佛教俱存，三大語系佛教典籍保存完整的國家。
ZW02n0000_p0047a12_##因此，編輯大藏經，從廣義的角度講，不僅僅包括漢文大藏經，還應
ZW02n0000_p0047a13_##該包括巴利語三藏與藏文甘珠兒、丹珠兒。正是出於這種考慮，八
ZW02n0000_p0047a14_##十年代初計劃編纂《中華大藏經》時，便有分階段逐步編纂漢文部
ZW02n0000_p0047a15_##分、藏文部分、傣文部分的設想。如今，《中華大藏經》漢文部分的
ZW02n0000_p0047a16_##上編已經編纂完成；藏文部分的編纂已經正式展開。繼續完成《中
ZW02n0000_p0047a17_##華大藏經》漢文部分的下編，以及按照原計劃編纂《中華大藏經》的
ZW02n0000_p0047a18_##藏文部分與傣文部分，是擺在我們面前的繁重的任務。
ZW02n0000_p0047a19_##<p,0,2>上面祇是問題的一個方面。問題的另一個方面是梵巴藏等佛
ZW02n0000_p0047a20_##典的翻譯。亦即將現存的梵巴藏等佛典全部翻譯成漢文，使我們
ZW02n0000_p0047a21_##的漢文大藏經包羅現存印度所有佛典及三大語系所有佛典，成為
ZW02n0000_p0047a22_##世界上最為完備的大藏經。這是我國佛教界、學術界想了近百年
ZW02n0000_p0047a23_##的事，它對中國佛教的健康發展，對中華民族的團結與交流，對佛
ZW02n0000_p0047a24_##教圈各國的團結與交流無疑都有著重要的積極意義。不過茲事體
ZW02n0000_p0047a25_##大，需要認真規劃統籌，組織與培養人材，非一朝一夕之功所能成
ZW02n0000_p0047a26_##就。我以為不妨根據現有條件，先做起來。至於將來怎樣，祇好有
ZW02n0000_p0047a27_##待各種因緣條件之成熟了。
ZW02n0000_p0047a28_##<p,0,2>與此事相關的是近代國外佛教學者名著的翻譯。他山之石，
ZW02n0000_p0048a01_##可以攻錯。這些書籍的翻譯對我國佛教研究的進一步深入自然有
ZW02n0000_p0048a02_##著重要的參考價值。不過，我以為這類書籍翻譯後可以專門編為
ZW02n0000_p0048a03_##叢書，不必編入大藏經。因為它們既不是傳統意義上的佛教藏經，
ZW02n0000_p0048a04_##其原文也不是漢文。
ZW02n0000_p0048a05_##<p,0,2>第四、形象性資料問題
ZW02n0000_p0048a06_##<p,0,2>除了文字性資料外，還應該考慮收入關於佛教的各種形象性
ZW02n0000_p0048a07_##資料。其內容，除了《大正藏》的「圖像部」所收的圖像外，還應該包
ZW02n0000_p0048a08_##括雕塑、繪畫（包括壁畫）、建築、法物器具等其他非文字的形象性
ZW02n0000_p0048a09_##資料。
ZW02n0000_p0048a10_##<p,0,2>二、編排科學
ZW02n0000_p0048a11_##<p,0,2>任何一部成功的叢書，總要有一個的結構分類，以把所收納的
ZW02n0000_p0048a12_##典籍組織成一個有機的整體，大藏經也不例外。這裡包括兩方面
ZW02n0000_p0048a13_##的問題：藏經的總體結構應如何科學地設計；某些具體典籍應如何
ZW02n0000_p0048a14_##正確地歸類。
ZW02n0000_p0048a15_##<p,0,2>我國大藏經的總體結構，是從南北朝到盛唐，經歷了數百年的
ZW02n0000_p0048a16_##反覆研究，纔由智昇基本確定的。智昇確定的大藏經結構垂範千
ZW02n0000_p0048a17_##年，為人們所稱道。但這一結構也有缺點，即受中國佛教重大輕小
ZW02n0000_p0048a18_##的傳統及某些派別判教思想的影響。「因此，他沒有，也不可能考
ZW02n0000_p0048a19_##慮到怎樣努力用大藏經的結構來反映佛教發展的歷史線索。」[01]
ZW02n0000_p0048a20_##明代我國僧人曾經對智昇確立的大藏經結構體系進行變革，但祇
ZW02n0000_p0048a21_##是採用不同的判教體系而已，其指導思想則沒有任何改變。本世
ZW02n0000_p0048a22_##紀日本《大正藏》纔真正打破古代的傳統，改用現代科學的眼光來
ZW02n0000_p0048a23_##看待佛典並進行分類。《大正藏》的分類實踐固然還有不少問題，
ZW02n0000_p0048a24_##但它在佛藏結構分類方面的開創性功績應該充分肯定。此後，不
ZW02n0000_p0048a25_##斷有學者從各個不同角度提出新的分類方案。臺灣《佛光藏》也正
ZW02n0000_p0048a26_##沿著《大正藏》的同一思路進行佛藏結構的新的探索。這些探索都
ZW02n0000_p0049a01_##值得肯定。在我國大陸近幾十年來影響較大的是呂澂先生的《新
ZW02n0000_p0049a02_##編漢文大藏經目錄》，目前有的圖書館依據這部目錄整理館藏佛教
ZW02n0000_p0049a03_##典籍，也有先生主張依據這部目錄編印新的大藏經。但我認為這
ZW02n0000_p0049a04_##種主張不可取。呂澂先生的目錄在不少具體經典的審定上用功
ZW02n0000_p0049a05_##甚大，許多具體結論都值得我們參考與吸取。但該目錄在總體結
ZW02n0000_p0049a06_##構上沒有擺脫中國傳統大藏經的重大輕小及判教思想的影響，還
ZW02n0000_p0049a07_##在傳統的大藏經結構中轉圈。因此不能作為我們今天編纂大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0049a08_##的結構基礎。
ZW02n0000_p0049a09_##<p,0,2>我認為，設計新的大藏經的總體結構的基本原則應為：（一）、
ZW02n0000_p0049a10_##採用科學分類的方法。走《大正藏》已經開闢、《佛光大藏經》正在
ZW02n0000_p0049a11_##進一步實踐的路。（二）、既要考慮佛教的學科組成，又要照顧佛典
ZW02n0000_p0049a12_##的現實情況。既要有完整的結構體系，又要有可操作性。
ZW02n0000_p0049a13_##<p,0,2>現在，對應該實踐上述第一條原則，人們比較容易達成一致的
ZW02n0000_p0049a14_##認識。但對於上述第二條原則，則想法一時還不能完全統一。海
ZW02n0000_p0049a15_##內外相當一部分先生總是希望先設計出一個較為理想的大藏經結
ZW02n0000_p0049a16_##構方案，然後按圖索驥，把收羅到佛典填充到這個結構中去。並且
ZW02n0000_p0049a17_##也已經設計出好幾套方案。縱觀這些方案，大抵理想主義的色彩
ZW02n0000_p0049a18_##比較濃，相對而言，在可操作性方面就差一點。因此，我建議對藏
ZW02n0000_p0049a19_##經結構問題，不急於馬上提出方案。是否在廣泛收集各種應該入
ZW02n0000_p0049a20_##藏的資料的同時，組織一個班子，對藏經結構問題作充分的前期研
ZW02n0000_p0049a21_##究。在充分把握已經收集到的各種佛典的全貌的基礎上，充分分
ZW02n0000_p0049a22_##析研究歷史上各種藏經結構之優劣，充分分析研究已經提出的各
ZW02n0000_p0049a23_##種分類方案的優劣，然後提出我們的方案。再召集有關專家多次
ZW02n0000_p0049a24_##論證，最後定稿。這樣制定出來的分類結構可能較為科學，且較能
ZW02n0000_p0049a25_##適合現存佛典的實際情況，便於操作。這項工作可與入藏資料的
ZW02n0000_p0049a26_##搜集同步進行，即同時開始，同時結束。
ZW02n0000_p0049a27_##<p,0,2>至於對某些具體典籍的歸類問題，一般可在解決上述藏經結
ZW02n0000_p0049a28_##構體系的過程中同時得到解決。個別難點則可視具體情況個別處
ZW02n0000_p0050a01_##理。
ZW02n0000_p0050a02_##<p,0,2>歸根結底，分類的作用是三條：一是通過分類反映佛教理論的
ZW02n0000_p0050a03_##總體框架並反映某一部典籍在該框架中地位；二是反映某一理論
ZW02n0000_p0050a04_##的學術淵源、流變及與該理論相關的具體典籍；三是便於檢索。從
ZW02n0000_p0050a05_##這個角度講，上面所講的佛典的結構分類及其對策更多的是針對
ZW02n0000_p0050a06_##傳統的書冊本大藏經而言的。但目前書籍已經進入光電時代，新
ZW02n0000_p0050a07_##出現的書籍載體形式，有沒有可能對書籍的傳統分類方式及理論
ZW02n0000_p0050a08_##提出革命性的變革？光電版的大藏經是否可以採取完全不同於傳
ZW02n0000_p0050a09_##統的檢索方式？可不可以這樣設想：除了以傳統的版本項作為檢
ZW02n0000_p0050a10_##索點之外，充分利用電腦高速運轉與字符串檢索的性能，通過檢索
ZW02n0000_p0050a11_##主題詞為主，書目提要為輔的方式來實現上述傳統分類的三大功
ZW02n0000_p0050a12_##能。我想，祇要大藏經總體的主題詞體系及每一部典籍的具體主
ZW02n0000_p0050a13_##題詞設計得科學準確，上述設想是有可能達到的。如果真的這樣
ZW02n0000_p0050a14_##做，入藏典籍便無需分類，祇要按照普通的流水號進行大排行就可
ZW02n0000_p0050a15_##以了。原來一直困擾我們的，必須把大藏經全部編輯完成，纔能按
ZW02n0000_p0050a16_##照結構次序逐部出版的問題也就不復存在。我們可以完全不考慮
ZW02n0000_p0050a17_##結構體系，僅以流水號為順序，哪部典籍整理完畢，就先輸入那一
ZW02n0000_p0050a18_##部。我想，我們不妨依照這種設想先作試驗。如果能夠成功，則在
ZW02n0000_p0050a19_##光電版大藏經中，傳統的分類方法將予廢除。
ZW02n0000_p0050a20_##<p,0,2>當然，這裡必須強調指出的是，光電版大藏經所廢除的祇是傳
ZW02n0000_p0050a21_##統的書冊本大藏經外在的分類方法，而內在的對佛教理論框架的
ZW02n0000_p0050a22_##研究，對某一佛典學術淵源及思想傾向、學說內容的研究不但不能
ZW02n0000_p0050a23_##廢除，而且必須加強。祇有這樣，纔能真正科學地設定全藏的主題
ZW02n0000_p0050a24_##詞體系與每一部典籍的主題詞。從這一角度講，光電版書籍的主
ZW02n0000_p0050a25_##題詞體系的設定不是對傳統分類法體系的廢除，而是站在傳統分
ZW02n0000_p0050a26_##類法體系基礎上對傳統分類法的全面揚棄。因此，即使對於光電
ZW02n0000_p0050a27_##版大藏經來說，前面所述組織一個班子對大藏經的結構體系與某
ZW02n0000_p0050a28_##些典籍的具體歸屬先期進行全面研究，仍然是十分重要的。
ZW02n0000_p0051a01_##<p,0,2>三、使用方便
ZW02n0000_p0051a02_##<p,0,2>藏經是一部收羅宏富的大叢書，篇幅浩大，內容龐雜。如何使
ZW02n0000_p0051a03_##管理者能夠有條不紊地管理它，使讀者能夠方便自如地使用它，就
ZW02n0000_p0051a04_##是一個很大的問題。古代，經過長期努力，人們終於創造出千字文
ZW02n0000_p0051a05_##帙號這樣有序的字號，以此來管理與檢索藏經。現代，隨著書籍載
ZW02n0000_p0051a06_##體的變化與學術的發展，所謂方便地使用藏經就不僅僅局限在外
ZW02n0000_p0051a07_##部帙號這一個問題上，它包括載體形式、校勘標點、目錄索引、實用
ZW02n0000_p0051a08_##辭書等四個方面。
ZW02n0000_p0051a09_##<p,0,2>第一、載體形式
ZW02n0000_p0051a10_##<p,0,2>古代，佛典的載體形式主要有紙抄與石刻兩種。紙抄者就其
ZW02n0000_p0051a11_##裝幀外形而言，又有卷軸裝、梵筴裝、蝶裝、包背裝、經折裝、線裝等
ZW02n0000_p0051a12_##等，近代又出現平裝、精裝、特精裝等等。石刻則有碑版、經幢、摩
ZW02n0000_p0051a13_##崖之不同。總的來說，載體與裝幀隨著時代的演進而不斷進化。
ZW02n0000_p0051a14_##一方面沿著更加方便實用前進，另一方面沿著更加豪華氣派發展。
ZW02n0000_p0051a15_##目前，世界書籍的載體雖然仍以紙質書冊為主要形態，但光電版書
ZW02n0000_p0051a16_##籍正在迅猛發展。有的人預言，光電版書籍進一步發展，終將使紙
ZW02n0000_p0051a17_##質書冊趨於消亡。但我認為，光電版與書冊版各有各的優勢，恐怕
ZW02n0000_p0051a18_##誰也不能取代誰。起碼在我們可以預期到的將來，書冊版必將繼
ZW02n0000_p0051a19_##續在人類文化生活中佔據重要地位。此外，從佛教大藏經的角度
ZW02n0000_p0051a20_##來考慮，如前所述，它除了義理型、備查型的功能之外，還有信仰性
ZW02n0000_p0051a21_##功能。這種信仰性功能要求大藏經能夠外化為某種能夠引起人們
ZW02n0000_p0051a22_##崇敬心理的形態。書冊版大藏經能夠起到這種作用，因為當人們
ZW02n0000_p0051a23_##面對藏經樓上數百冊莊嚴精美的書冊版大藏經時，很容易產生「法
ZW02n0000_p0051a24_##海無涯」的讚歎之情。但不能想像人們會對一片薄薄的光盤也產
ZW02n0000_p0051a25_##生同樣的感情，並去頂禮膜拜。因此，我們現在編藏，必須兼顧當
ZW02n0000_p0051a26_##前與將來，學術研究與宗教供養，應該是書冊版、光電版兩種形式
ZW02n0000_p0051a27_##並重，不可偏廢。
ZW02n0000_p0051a28_##<p,0,2>無論書冊版還是光電版，都可以有影印原典、校訂重排兩種形
ZW02n0000_p0052a01_##式。從保存原始資料、快速簡便來說，當數影印。目前坊間影印出
ZW02n0000_p0052a02_##版的大部頭佛教叢書不斷湧現，正是因為出版商看中影印本簡捷
ZW02n0000_p0052a03_##易行，利潤豐厚的緣故。好的影印本的確起到提供稀有資料與稀
ZW02n0000_p0052a04_##有版本的作用。但是，目前不少影印的佛教叢書祇是從常見大藏
ZW02n0000_p0052a05_##經中選取若干典籍，所收既非稀有文獻，又沒有原原本本地完全按
ZW02n0000_p0052a06_##照原樣影印，而是任意修版、割版，還不作任何說明。這樣，不但沒
ZW02n0000_p0052a07_##有提供資料的價值，反而起到魚目混珠、淆亂版本、誤導研究的惡
ZW02n0000_p0052a08_##劣作用。是我們不應該提倡的。
ZW02n0000_p0052a09_##<p,0,2>如果從學術性、普及性、影響力講，無疑要推重排。因為祇有
ZW02n0000_p0052a10_##重排，纔能夠把對佛典的校勘成果直接反映在正文中，並進行標
ZW02n0000_p0052a11_##點，以向讀者提供一個具有較高學術水平的精校標點本。祇有重
ZW02n0000_p0052a12_##排，纔能夠用正字法把各種版本佛典中的正俗字、古今字、異體字、
ZW02n0000_p0052a13_##錯別字等文字的問題解決掉，減少人們閱讀的困難。還有，由於底
ZW02n0000_p0052a14_##本來源不一，如果採用影印，則編成的大藏經必然是百衲本；祇有
ZW02n0000_p0052a15_##重排，纔能夠使它版式劃一，肅穆莊嚴。此外，單純影印，反映的祇
ZW02n0000_p0052a16_##是編纂者收集資料的功夫；祇有重排，纔能真正反映出編纂者整理
ZW02n0000_p0052a17_##資料的水平。因此，我們要編纂出總結當代，開創未來的高水平大
ZW02n0000_p0052a18_##藏經，除了重排，別無他途。
ZW02n0000_p0052a19_##<p,0,2>那麼，是否此次編藏，祇考慮重排，完全不考慮影印呢？我以
ZW02n0000_p0052a20_##為也不必那麼機械。實際上，如果我們能夠把歷代諸種藏經分別
ZW02n0000_p0052a21_##影印，則這些影印本不但可以成為此次編藏的原始資料，成為今後
ZW02n0000_p0052a22_##深入研究的基本依據，也可以成為各寺院珍貴的供養本。可以設
ZW02n0000_p0052a23_##想，在為編纂大藏經收集資料的過程中，會自然具備影印歷代藏經
ZW02n0000_p0052a24_##的條件，我們不應放棄如此難得的機緣。因此我建議：立足於重
ZW02n0000_p0052a25_##排，不放棄影印，重視配套，錯落發行。
ZW02n0000_p0052a26_##<p,0,2>既然是書冊版、光電版並重；以重排為主，不放棄可能條件下
ZW02n0000_p0052a27_##的影印。那麼，在電腦錄入的時候，是否可以不採用目前通行的人
ZW02n0000_p0052a28_##工打字，而採用掃瞄。即第一道工序，先將底本按照原樣掃瞄收入
ZW02n0000_p0053a01_##電腦。第二道工序，由電腦進行單字辨認，確定正字。當底校本均
ZW02n0000_p0053a02_##用這種方式掃瞄完畢，即可以利用電腦自動校勘程序校出各本的
ZW02n0000_p0053a03_##異同，然後送給專家審定，以選用正文，確定異文。採用這種方式
ZW02n0000_p0053a04_##的優點是：（一）、可以迴避目前海內外在實施光電版佛典計劃中普
ZW02n0000_p0053a05_##遍遇到的錄入員不認識繁難漢字及校對瓶頸問題。（二）、可以減
ZW02n0000_p0053a06_##少錯誤率。（三）、可以大大減輕校勘的工作量，從而大大加快校勘
ZW02n0000_p0053a07_##的速度。（四）、可以產生出一個重要的副產品：《漢字正俗字、古今
ZW02n0000_p0053a08_##字、異體字、錯別字大彙》，並對此進行各種數理統計。由於大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0053a09_##字數多，年代久，對全體漢字的覆蓋面無與倫比，因此，這一《大彙》
ZW02n0000_p0053a10_##一定會具有極大的學術性與權威性，從而對漢字本身的研究與規
ZW02n0000_p0053a11_##範化，對漢字的電腦化，都將是重大貢獻。（五）、可與前述影印歷
ZW02n0000_p0053a12_##代藏經的工作配套進行。
ZW02n0000_p0053a13_##<p,0,2>當然，上述設想的前提是電腦有承擔這些工作的功能，或可以
ZW02n0000_p0053a14_##開發出這些功能，否則，祇能是空想。這個問題，要請電腦專家來
ZW02n0000_p0053a15_##回答。
ZW02n0000_p0053a16_##<p,0,2>第二、校勘標點
ZW02n0000_p0053a17_##<p,0,2>當代，古籍整理中有無校勘與標點，其校勘標點的水平如何，
ZW02n0000_p0053a18_##是衡量這一古籍整理是否成功的重要標準。
ZW02n0000_p0053a19_##<p,0,2>佛典校勘，指底校本對勘與中外文（即中文與梵、巴、藏文）對
ZW02n0000_p0053a20_##勘。校勘工作可以有各種做法。就底校本對勘而言，我們就可以
ZW02n0000_p0053a21_##設計出幾個方案。
ZW02n0000_p0053a22_##<p,0,2>比如，（一）、[象>像]《大正藏》與《中華藏》那樣，對底校本祇指異，不
ZW02n0000_p0053a23_##辨正。如果這樣，則如前所述，祇要電腦有自動校勘程序，即可承
ZW02n0000_p0053a24_##擔，不必再由專家釐定。（二）、像我們《藏外佛教文獻》的各種整理
ZW02n0000_p0053a25_##本那樣，以既「精」且「博」為標準，一律辨別正誤，並羅列異文。那
ZW02n0000_p0053a26_##麼，必須動員一批專家參加釐定。
ZW02n0000_p0053a27_##<p,0,2>又比如，（一）、雖然校勘，但並不依據底校本原典一字一字去
ZW02n0000_p0053a28_##校，而是充分利用前人的校勘成果。這種方案是針對人工錄入而
ZW02n0000_p0054a01_##言的。這樣做的好處是可以大大加快速度；風險是如果前人校勘
ZW02n0000_p0054a02_##有錯誤，則我們也跟著錯。如果採用電腦掃瞄錄入，電腦校勘，則
ZW02n0000_p0054a03_##這種方案全無用處。（二）、雖然也參考前人的校勘成果，但自己照
ZW02n0000_p0054a04_##舊老老實實地一字一字地將底校本全部審校一過。這種方案，無
ZW02n0000_p0054a05_##論對於人工錄入還是掃瞄錄入，全都有效。
ZW02n0000_p0054a06_##<p,0,2>就中外文對勘而言，也可以有不同的方法：（一）、凡有相應原
ZW02n0000_p0054a07_##本者，一律逐字核對。（二）、僅核對重要名相與專用名詞。
ZW02n0000_p0054a08_##<p,0,2>同樣，標點也可以有不同的做法。比如：（一）、祇斷句。（二）、
ZW02n0000_p0054a09_##加句讀。（三）、部分採用新式標點（即採用部分適用於佛典的標點
ZW02n0000_p0054a10_##符號，廢棄部分不適用於佛典的標點符號）。（四）、全式標點。
ZW02n0000_p0054a11_##（五）、上述幾種形式並存，即哪種方式適用，就採用那一種。
ZW02n0000_p0054a12_##<p,0,2>考慮到漢文大藏經總體規模達4.5億字，考慮到大藏經存在
ZW02n0000_p0054a13_##著的諸種不同版本，我們必須對校勘與標點的工作量之大有充分
ZW02n0000_p0054a14_##的估計。實際上，至今為止，祇要是重排本，則所有編纂大藏者的
ZW02n0000_p0054a15_##主要精力都是花費在校勘與標點上。我們也不會例外。但是，校
ZW02n0000_p0054a16_##勘與標點又是我們編藏，也是目前所有從事佛典整理的人不可迴
ZW02n0000_p0054a17_##避的大事。應該怎麼辦呢？我認為，考慮到電子文件的開放性、易
ZW02n0000_p0054a18_##於修改性與便於昇級性，是否可以提出這麼兩條基本原則：
ZW02n0000_p0054a19_##<p,0,2>（一），放眼長遠，必須堅持高標準，進行認真的校勘與標點；
ZW02n0000_p0054a20_##<p,0,2>（二），立足當前，適當採取一些變通的辦法。
ZW02n0000_p0054a21_##<p,0,2>就是說，一方面我們必須樹立高標準，堅持高標準；另一方面，
ZW02n0000_p0054a22_##我們可以把這個標準的實現分解為若干個階段，確立每個階段的
ZW02n0000_p0054a23_##現實目標。這種現實目標應該是適合我們每個階段的實際情況
ZW02n0000_p0054a24_##的，經過努力可以做到的，又必須是與下一階段目標乃至最終的高
ZW02n0000_p0054a25_##標準相銜接的。
ZW02n0000_p0054a26_##<p,0,2>根據我的經驗，上述問題，祇要事前考慮周全，安排好，具體實
ZW02n0000_p0054a27_##施起來並不太難。如果在全面啟動之後，中途再作改進，則會相當
ZW02n0000_p0054a28_##困難，甚至雖有好的方案而無從措手足。此外，事先統一思想便於
ZW02n0000_p0055a01_##和衷共濟，中途變法改革容易引發糾紛，這也是可以理解的。
ZW02n0000_p0055a02_##<p,0,2>第三、目錄索引
ZW02n0000_p0055a03_##<p,0,2>準確的總目、詳盡的版本目錄及各種實用索引是衡量一部大
ZW02n0000_p0055a04_##藏經學術水平的重要依據，也是使讀者便於利用該大藏經的有效
ZW02n0000_p0055a05_##方法。
ZW02n0000_p0055a06_##<p,0,2>總目是對該大藏經的總體把握。版本目錄則需要詳細交代底
ZW02n0000_p0055a07_##校本的情況。實用索引包括經名（含異名）索引、譯著者索引、詞語
ZW02n0000_p0055a08_##索引。由於採用電腦工作，目錄與索引的具體編製過程將會比較
ZW02n0000_p0055a09_##順利。但需要解決好如下幾個問題：
ZW02n0000_p0055a10_##<p,0,2>（一）、異譯本的比照、著譯者的考釋。歷代大藏經中遺留的此
ZW02n0000_p0055a11_##類問題比較多，給佛教研究製造不少混亂。我們應該解決之。
ZW02n0000_p0055a12_##<p,0,2>（二）、最佳電腦檢索系統的編程或選擇、人工採詞與電腦採詞
ZW02n0000_p0055a13_##的最佳配合。
ZW02n0000_p0055a14_##<p,0,2>（三）、人工採詞需要對佛教有相當研究的人員纔能夠承擔，必
ZW02n0000_p0055a15_##須注意這方面人才的組織與培養。
ZW02n0000_p0055a16_##<p,0,2>第四、實用辭書
ZW02n0000_p0055a17_##<p,0,2>很多人認為佛典很難讀，視之為畏途。其實，佛典的思想並沒
ZW02n0000_p0055a18_##有深奧到令今人無法理解的地步。佛典的難讀是由於其他原因造
ZW02n0000_p0055a19_##成的，其中一個重要原因就是佛教有一套固有的名相、法數，也就
ZW02n0000_p0055a20_##是有一套自己的概念體系。不瞭解某學科的概念體系，就無法讀
ZW02n0000_p0055a21_##懂某學科的書籍，這是很自然的事。我們如果能夠為大藏經編撰
ZW02n0000_p0055a22_##配套的實用辭書，將是這部大藏經的創新，也將是使這部大藏經更
ZW02n0000_p0055a23_##加學術化、普及化的重要途徑。實用辭書與光電版大藏配套，可以
ZW02n0000_p0055a24_##使這部大藏經的使用極為方便。
ZW02n0000_p0055a25_##<p,0,2>我認為，可以先從現有的佛典音義、《翻譯名義集》等古代辭書
ZW02n0000_p0055a26_##及有代表性的佛教詞典、梵巴藏詞典等現代辭書採詞，編纂成數據
ZW02n0000_p0055a27_##庫。進而將該辭書數據庫與前述詞語索引以及佛典原文作成關聯
ZW02n0000_p0055a28_##數據庫。這樣，在閱讀某部佛典，需要瞭解某詞的意義時，可以查
ZW02n0000_p0056a01_##閱古今諸詞典對該詞的解釋及其他佛典對該詞的用例或解釋。這
ZW02n0000_p0056a02_##對佛典的理解與外文翻譯，作用極大。現在我們沒有力量來編纂
ZW02n0000_p0056a03_##新的大型佛教詞典。但上述實用辭書的編纂，必將為今後編撰高
ZW02n0000_p0056a04_##質量佛教詞典奠定基礎。
ZW02n0000_p0056a05_##
ZW02n0000_p0056a06_##<p,0,2>我想，如果我們能夠編纂出符合上述標準的大藏經，那就可以
ZW02n0000_p0056a07_##說在佛教史上，在中國文化史上，在世界文化史上樹立起一座豐
ZW02n0000_p0056a08_##碑。無愧於前人，無愧於後代。
ZW02n0000_p0056a09_##
ZW02n0000_p0056a10Q3#三
ZW02n0000_p0056a11_##<p,0,2>我們有沒有可能編纂出這麼一部大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0056a12_##<p,0,2>編撰這樣一部大藏經需要如下條件：良好的外部環境；充裕的
ZW02n0000_p0056a13_##人力、財力、資料資源；計算機技術保證。
ZW02n0000_p0056a14_##<p,0,2>第一、就外部環境而言，目前我國社會穩定，經濟發展，正逢中
ZW02n0000_p0056a15_##國歷史上少有的盛世之一；我國既有盛世修典的傳統，又有歷代編
ZW02n0000_p0056a16_##藏的傳統；宗教界、學術界對編纂一部高水平大藏經已經企盼了近
ZW02n0000_p0056a17_##百年，有著現實的積極性；社會各界對佛教的認識與觀感也正逐步
ZW02n0000_p0056a18_##趨於符合佛教的本來面貌。應該說，良好的外部環境這一條已經
ZW02n0000_p0056a19_##基本具備。實際上，海內外各種各樣的編藏工程已經啟動。
ZW02n0000_p0056a20_##<p,0,2>第二、人力主要指參與具體工作的人員，包括：一、搜集鑒定整
ZW02n0000_p0056a21_##理資料人員，二、校勘標點人員，三、電腦工作人員，四、攝影人員，
ZW02n0000_p0056a22_##五、公關人員，六、後勤服務人員，七、學術指導人員。
ZW02n0000_p0056a23_##<p,0,2>人力包括質、量兩個方面。我國目前有一批德高望重的老專
ZW02n0000_p0056a24_##家，有一批中青年學者，新的力量還在成長。從總體實力看，應該
ZW02n0000_p0056a25_##說不亞於當年編纂《大正藏》的班子。我們既充分吸收前人編藏的
ZW02n0000_p0056a26_##經驗教訓，又有編纂《中華大藏經》上編的實踐經驗。因此，在人員
ZW02n0000_p0056a27_##的素質方面，應該說基本符合條件。問題是怎樣在一個共同的目
ZW02n0000_p0056a28_##標之下把這批力量組織與團結起來。
ZW02n0000_p0057a01_##<p,0,2>人員的量則以工作量最大、且要求有相當水平的校勘標點人
ZW02n0000_p0057a02_##員為例談談。假如新的大藏經總量為4.5億字，擬定用7年時間
ZW02n0000_p0057a03_##校勘標點完。則每年需要完成0.7億字。又假如每個符合條件的
ZW02n0000_p0057a04_##工作人員利用業餘時間每月可以校勘標點5萬字（平均每天校勘
ZW02n0000_p0057a05_##標點1700字），每人每年可以完成50萬字，則我們如果能夠從全
ZW02n0000_p0057a06_##國近年培養的佛教、中哲史的碩士、博士中，從全國各大學哲學系
ZW02n0000_p0057a07_##的教師中，從各佛學院的師生中以及其他符合條件的人員中選聘
ZW02n0000_p0057a08_##140人從事這項工作。再在北京選聘20個水平相對較高的人員
ZW02n0000_p0057a09_##專門進行覆核。就可以了。祇要有經濟力量，經過努力，在全國與
ZW02n0000_p0057a10_##北京選聘二百個左右符合所需條件的人員還是可以做到的。
ZW02n0000_p0057a11_##<p,0,2>實際上如前所述，可以讓電腦承擔相當大一部分校勘工作，從
ZW02n0000_p0057a12_##而大大減少校勘人員的工作量。而且，現有佛典完全沒有標點，需
ZW02n0000_p0057a13_##要從零做起的祇是極少數。大部分佛典已經有句讀或斷句。因
ZW02n0000_p0057a14_##此，校勘標點問題並沒有想像的那樣困難。
ZW02n0000_p0057a15_##<p,0,2>編纂大藏經，並非僅是簡單的佛教文獻整理，應該把它同我國
ZW02n0000_p0057a16_##佛教的健康發展聯[係>繫]起來，統籌安排。講到佛教的健康發展，用佛
ZW02n0000_p0057a17_##教語言來說，關鍵是「紹隆佛種，續佛慧命」，也就是接班人的問題。
ZW02n0000_p0057a18_##而接班人不僅需要熟悉佛教儀軌，遵守佛教戒律，還必須精通佛教
ZW02n0000_p0057a19_##義理，甚至能夠發展佛教義理。我認為，佛教理論是佛教的靈魂。
ZW02n0000_p0057a20_##宋明以前，印度佛教的理論不斷傳入，中國人在消化這些理論的過
ZW02n0000_p0057a21_##程中不斷有所創新，從而使佛教生機勃勃，在意識形態領域擅一時
ZW02n0000_p0057a22_##之勝場。宋明以降，印度佛教已經衰滅，源頭活水已斷，中國佛教
ZW02n0000_p0057a23_##此時既沒有理論上的重大創新，原有的佛教理論又為宋明理學所
ZW02n0000_p0057a24_##吸收，於是祇剩一個信仰的軀殼，這是佛教走向衰落的重要原因。
ZW02n0000_p0057a25_##我們說近代佛教復興，其標誌首先是「南歐北韓」及一批高僧大德
ZW02n0000_p0057a26_##對佛教義理的鑽研與弘揚。因此，對當前佛教界來說，培養一批高
ZW02n0000_p0057a27_##水平的理論人才，提高理論水平，提高文化檔次，乃是當務之急。
ZW02n0000_p0057a28_##編纂大藏經，對於佛教界來說，也正是培養佛種，弘研義理的極好
ZW02n0000_p0058a01_##機遇。所以，是否可由中國佛學院（或擬議中的中國佛教大學）開
ZW02n0000_p0058a02_##設有針對性的專業，一邊學習，一邊參加編藏實踐，在工作中培養，
ZW02n0000_p0058a03_##在實踐中提高，培養出一批跨世紀的高僧大德。其實，對學術界而
ZW02n0000_p0058a04_##言，也同樣應該利用編纂大藏經的機會，為下世紀培養出一批不務
ZW02n0000_p0058a05_##空言的專家學者。如果大家都從這個思路來考慮問題，則我們編
ZW02n0000_p0058a06_##纂大藏經，既出成果，又出人才，還能促進佛教及佛教研究的健康
ZW02n0000_p0058a07_##發展。幾全其美，何樂而不為？
ZW02n0000_p0058a08_##<p,0,2>總之，人力問題固然有困難，但並非不可解決。
ZW02n0000_p0058a09_##<p,0,2>第三、大藏經如此巨大的工程，耗資必然可觀。根據資料，日
ZW02n0000_p0058a10_##本《大正藏》共耗資280萬日圓，瞭解二、三十年代日本物價水平的
ZW02n0000_p0058a11_##人都知道，這在當時是一筆相當大的數字。《中華大藏經》共接受
ZW02n0000_p0058a12_##國家撥款人民幣158萬。那是由於八十年代初的社會觀念與現在
ZW02n0000_p0058a13_##大不一樣，也由於《中華大藏經》是國家項目，各單位都比較支持。
ZW02n0000_p0058a14_##我們借用的資料，基本上都沒有支付資料費，雙方協議，由中華大
ZW02n0000_p0058a15_##藏經編輯局贈送各資料收藏單位一部《中華大藏經》作為感謝。另
ZW02n0000_p0058a16_##外，所聘人員的報酬都比較低，應聘人員大多屬於離退休後發揮餘
ZW02n0000_p0058a17_##熱，甘作貢獻。但上述做法，顯然已經不再適合目前的情況。我們
ZW02n0000_p0058a18_##現在編纂《藏外佛教文獻》，深感無錢困難重重，寸步難行。由於經
ZW02n0000_p0058a19_##費緊張，許多事情都想儘量省錢，結果適得其反，反而更加費錢。
ZW02n0000_p0058a20_##由此捉襟見肘，狼狽不堪。教訓實在深刻。
ZW02n0000_p0058a21_##<p,0,2>本人一介書生，對於經濟問題純屬外行。按照上述設想編纂
ZW02n0000_p0058a22_##一部理想的大藏經，究竟需要多少經費，要由有關專家框算。不
ZW02n0000_p0058a23_##過，編纂工作是逐步展開，在若干年內完成，後期可與藏經的出版
ZW02n0000_p0058a24_##發行配合進行，所需經費也就可以滾動解決。所以，實際上需要籌
ZW02n0000_p0058a25_##備的祇是前期的經費。
ZW02n0000_p0058a26_##<p,0,2>目前，佛教界結緣經書的印刷量很大。有的結緣經書無論是
ZW02n0000_p0058a27_##內容，還是印刷，都可以稱為上品。大多則是平平。其中也不乏粗
ZW02n0000_p0058a28_##糙拙劣之書籍。這些粗糙拙劣之書，從世法說是偽劣產品，從佛法
ZW02n0000_p0059a01_##說是褻瀆正法。因此，如果能夠把目前印刷結緣經書的資金吸引
ZW02n0000_p0059a02_##集中起來，一方面印刷一些精品經書結緣，另一方面則可用於大藏
ZW02n0000_p0059a03_##經的編纂。實際上，結緣經書與大藏經兩者本來就可以充分協調，
ZW02n0000_p0059a04_##相互為用。即用大藏經編撰人員整理出的精校定本作為結緣經書
ZW02n0000_p0059a05_##印刷，其傳播正法的作用自然遠遠超過在條件沒有保證情況下粗
ZW02n0000_p0059a06_##製濫造印出的書籍。而編纂印刷大藏經，本身就是功德更加無量
ZW02n0000_p0059a07_##的結緣勝事。
ZW02n0000_p0059a08_##<p,0,2>目前，海內外電子佛典的發展勢頭如同萬馬奔騰。遺憾的是
ZW02n0000_p0059a09_##各自為戰，缺乏協調，由此造成人力物力的極大浪費。如果能夠把
ZW02n0000_p0059a10_##這些分散的力量集中起來，則經費問題的解決也容易得多了。
ZW02n0000_p0059a11_##<p,0,2>當然，這樣的事情，說起來容易，做起來難。「蜀道之難，難於
ZW02n0000_p0059a12_##上青天」。而把海內外分散的結緣資金、分散的編藏力量集中到前
ZW02n0000_p0059a13_##述編纂大藏經的總目標下，可能比李白越蜀道更難，「側身西望長
ZW02n0000_p0059a14_##咨嗟」。
ZW02n0000_p0059a15_##<p,0,2>第四、編藏要有資料，沒有資料一切都是空話。如前所述，新
ZW02n0000_p0059a16_##編藏經包括歷代入藏與新編入藏兩大部分。歷代正藏、續藏資料
ZW02n0000_p0059a17_##現成，祇要整理、考訂、校勘、標點即可。關鍵工作在於新編入藏。
ZW02n0000_p0059a18_##<p,0,2>應該新編入藏的藏外佛教文獻主要指古代逸籍（包括敦煌遺
ZW02n0000_p0059a19_##書、海內外各宗教、圖書、文博部門及私人收藏未入藏逸籍）、近現
ZW02n0000_p0059a20_##代新譯（從梵、巴、藏、日等文字譯出）、散見於正史、地方史誌、金
ZW02n0000_p0059a21_##石、檔案、個人文集乃至各種叢書、類書、專著中佛教資料，此外還
ZW02n0000_p0059a22_##有今人撰著。雖然範圍很大，但是目標清楚。祇要有關收藏單位
ZW02n0000_p0059a23_##積極配合，收集起來應該沒有問題。當然，我們必須充分估計國內
ZW02n0000_p0059a24_##因部門封鎖資料而產生的困難。另外，不少資料散在海外，國外，
ZW02n0000_p0059a25_##包括港臺、日本、朝鮮、韓國、越南。西方則以英、法、俄、美、德、意、
ZW02n0000_p0059a26_##荷為主。我們有沒有可能把這些資料都收集起來？
ZW02n0000_p0059a27_##<p,0,2>總的來說，已經入藏的典籍，猶如陳列在公共圖書館中的圖
ZW02n0000_p0059a28_##書，誰都可以利用。因此，我們也好，任何一個企圖編纂藏經的組
ZW02n0000_p0060a01_##織與團體也好，誰都無所謂優勢。當然，如果講到歷代藏經的版
ZW02n0000_p0060a02_##本，則優勢在大陸與日本，日本的版本優勢在宋元，大陸的版本優
ZW02n0000_p0060a03_##勢在明清。至於新編入藏部分，雖說海外散落了一大批大陸已經
ZW02n0000_p0060a04_##亡佚的資料，但從總體看，應該說我們還是有優勢。我們應該充分
ZW02n0000_p0060a05_##發揮這個優勢。當然，編纂一部高水平的大藏經實際是世界華人
ZW02n0000_p0060a06_##的共同心願與事業，也是整個漢傳佛教文化圈的共同事業與理想，
ZW02n0000_p0060a07_##是東亞人民對人類文化的共同貢獻。我們要有發動與團結一切力
ZW02n0000_p0060a08_##量，共同做好這件曠世大事的大願心，大胸懷；不要有封疆劃界、唯
ZW02n0000_p0060a09_##我獨尊的想法。當然，作為一個中國人，一個華人，毫無疑問應該
ZW02n0000_p0060a10_##為祖先留下的這份文化遺產承擔更多的責任。
ZW02n0000_p0060a11_##<p,0,2>第五、對於電腦技術，本人是外行。從外行的角度考慮問題，
ZW02n0000_p0060a12_##大致有如下幾個方面：漢字字庫，檢索系統，單字掃瞄，關係數據
ZW02n0000_p0060a13_##庫。這些問題要靠電腦專家來解決。電腦技術本身正在一日千里
ZW02n0000_p0060a14_##地發展，即使我們現在就動手編纂，第一批成果的正式發行也要到
ZW02n0000_p0060a15_##五、六年之後，所以，即使現在電腦方面還有一些技術難關，相信還
ZW02n0000_p0060a16_##有時間來逐一解決。
ZW02n0000_p0060a17_##<p,0,2>綜合上述五點，我認為，編纂大藏經及其光電版的基本條件已
ZW02n0000_p0060a18_##經具備。現在的關鍵是必須有國家強有力的支持與充足的財力。
ZW02n0000_p0060a19_##如果這兩個方面能夠保證，前景是樂觀的。
ZW02n0000_p0060a20_##<p,0,2>以往的經驗證明，祇要國家重視，集中力量去做，就沒有辦不
ZW02n0000_p0060a21_##成的事，也沒有辦不好的事。大藏經編纂也是這樣。
ZW02n0000_p0060a22_##
ZW02n0000_p0060a23Q3#四
ZW02n0000_p0060a24_##<p,0,2>怎樣纔能編纂好我們所希望的這樣一部大藏經？
ZW02n0000_p0060a25_##<p,0,2>大家知道，1982年，在當時國務院古籍整理規劃領導小組，尤
ZW02n0000_p0060a26_##其是李一氓同志的支持下，由任繼愈先生主持，成立了「中華大藏
ZW02n0000_p0060a27_##經編輯局」，開始了中華人民共和國的大藏經編纂事業。這項工作
ZW02n0000_p0060a28_##從1982年中立項上馬，1994年底完成上編，共12年半。我是
ZW02n0000_p0061a01_##1984年秋開始參與的。該事業前期由李富華同志作為任先生的
ZW02n0000_p0061a02_##助手，協調工作。我則在前期中的半年，加上後期，共約六年半期
ZW02n0000_p0061a03_##間，作為任先生的助手協調工作。我出國期間，由其他同志負責。
ZW02n0000_p0061a04_##由於參加這項工作時間比較長，對情況，尤其對後期的情況比較了
ZW02n0000_p0061a05_##解。所以在此想介紹一下《中華大藏經》的編纂情況與我們對下一
ZW02n0000_p0061a06_##步工作的設想。我希望《中華大藏經》計劃與我們現在討論的大藏
ZW02n0000_p0061a07_##經編纂協調進行。
ZW02n0000_p0061a08_##<p,0,2>《中華大藏經》最初計劃分為正、續兩編，正編收入歷代大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0061a09_##之有千字文帙號的部分；續編收入歷代大藏經之無千字文帙號的
ZW02n0000_p0061a10_##部分。也就是說，正、續兩編合起來，相當於傳統大藏經的正藏與
ZW02n0000_p0061a11_##續藏。如前所述，新編入藏應該成為我們今天編纂大藏經的重點，
ZW02n0000_p0061a12_##正因為考慮到這一點，所以我們內部後來有過增加第三編，即新編
ZW02n0000_p0061a13_##入藏的設想。但又考慮到大藏經本身應該是一個嚴密的體系，如
ZW02n0000_p0061a14_##果採用上述正編、續編、第三編的方式，則將割裂這一體系。所以
ZW02n0000_p0061a15_##決定改為上、下兩編。上編為歷代大藏經之有千字文帙號的部分，
ZW02n0000_p0061a16_##即原來的正編；下編的主體為歷代大藏經之無千字文帙號及新編
ZW02n0000_p0061a17_##入藏部分，並以存目的形式包容上編，從而使下編以一個嚴密完整
ZW02n0000_p0061a18_##的大藏經的面貌出現。上編共106冊，每冊100萬字左右，總計
ZW02n0000_p0061a19_##1.06億字，編輯工作已在1994年結束，至今已經出版了90冊，全
ZW02n0000_p0061a20_##藏可望在今年全部出版。下編的準備工作正在進行。
ZW02n0000_p0061a21_##<p,0,2>上編以《趙城金藏》為基礎，加上其餘各藏有千字文帙號的佛
ZW02n0000_p0061a22_##典影印而成。由於受這一方式的影響，如標點等問題根本不可能
ZW02n0000_p0061a23_##考慮。現在有些同志對《中華藏》有一定的意見，如標點問題、結構
ZW02n0000_p0061a24_##編次問題等等，戲稱之為「百衲本」。這些批評都是正確的。編纂
ZW02n0000_p0061a25_##之初，的確希望這部《中華藏》能夠起到取代《大正藏》的作用，而現
ZW02n0000_p0061a26_##在實際上《中華藏》上編沒有能夠完全實現這個目標。但《中華藏》
ZW02n0000_p0061a27_##上編收入了不少《大正藏》沒有收入的資料，《中華藏》依據有代表
ZW02n0000_p0061a28_##性的八種藏經，尤其是首次全面利用《房山石經》作了校勘，這都是
ZW02n0000_p0062a01_##其他藏經沒有做到的。但它畢竟是十四年以前上馬的一個項目，
ZW02n0000_p0062a02_##與現在相比，當時各方面條件都比較差，尤其是人員基礎差。除了
ZW02n0000_p0062a03_##少數專業人員外，《中華藏》主要依靠從社會招聘的離退休人員（大
ZW02n0000_p0062a04_##多為中學教師與機關幹部）完成的。所以，《中華藏》成為現在這個
ZW02n0000_p0062a05_##樣子，完全是當時的條件所決定的。
ZW02n0000_p0062a06_##<p,0,2>從中華藏編輯局的角度來說，我們對此也並不滿意。任繼愈
ZW02n0000_p0062a07_##先生多次指示要設法改進，要提高質量。1986年，我們曾經特意
ZW02n0000_p0062a08_##向國務院古籍小組提出過改進意見。但是，當時《中華藏》已經出
ZW02n0000_p0062a09_##版了十餘冊，有關人員表示，如果進行改動，那已經出版的怎麼辦？
ZW02n0000_p0062a10_##的確，一部大叢書，體例一旦確定，前若干冊書一旦推出，則很難再
ZW02n0000_p0062a11_##作更改。這也是我們今天從事大藏經編纂必須重視的問題。
ZW02n0000_p0062a12_##<p,0,2>對於《中華大藏經》的下編，我們考慮其工作大體分三個階段：
ZW02n0000_p0062a13_##<p,0,2>一、準備階段，約五年。
ZW02n0000_p0062a14_##<p,0,2>目標：本階段完成資料搜集、整理、考釋工作，藏經結構架構工
ZW02n0000_p0062a15_##作，編撰出大藏經總目初稿、版本目錄初稿、經名索引、譯著者索
ZW02n0000_p0062a16_##引。完成電腦硬、軟件諸項準備。從第二年或第三年開始，穿插進
ZW02n0000_p0062a17_##行電腦錄入、校勘標點，以此組織與訓練隊伍。並開始詞語索引與
ZW02n0000_p0062a18_##實用辭書的編輯。
ZW02n0000_p0062a19_##<p,0,2>二、編輯發行階段，約八年。
ZW02n0000_p0062a20_##<p,0,2>目標：按照總目順序，全面鋪開編輯（校勘、標點、定稿）。校勘
ZW02n0000_p0062a21_##標點工作按照前述每年0.7億字的速度進行，到第五年可以全部
ZW02n0000_p0062a22_##完成。覆核定稿工作也按照每年0.7億字的速度進行，到第七年
ZW02n0000_p0062a23_##可以全部完成。本階段第二年開始可以按照每年70冊（每冊100
ZW02n0000_p0062a24_##萬字）的速度出版發行書冊本，到第八年全部出版（總計450冊）。
ZW02n0000_p0062a25_##待詞語索引與實用辭書之關聯數據庫配套成功，主題詞體系設計
ZW02n0000_p0062a26_##完成，開始發行光盤版。
ZW02n0000_p0062a27_##<p,0,2>三、收尾後續階段，約二年。
ZW02n0000_p0062a28_##<p,0,2>目標：處理善後事項。
ZW02n0000_p0063a01_##<p,0,2>限於時間與篇幅，上面祇是粗線條地介紹我們的基本設想，這
ZW02n0000_p0063a02_##是以我們多年的實際工作經驗為依據的。由於我們是按照全藏
ZW02n0000_p0063a03_##4.5億字計算校勘、標點、複審、定稿的工作量。而實際上全藏需
ZW02n0000_p0063a04_##要校勘標點的並沒有4.5億字。就複審定稿而言，亦有繁難與簡
ZW02n0000_p0063a05_##易之不同。因此，上述計劃還是留有相當大餘地的。此外，如果充
ZW02n0000_p0063a06_##分發揮電腦的功用，還可以大大減略上述工作量。
ZW02n0000_p0063a07_##<p,0,2>當然，如前所述，上述設想是以國家強有力的支持與充裕的財
ZW02n0000_p0063a08_##力保證為前提的。否則，祇是空想。
ZW02n0000_p0063a09_##<p,0,2>編纂大藏經，學術性極強。沒有有關專家的大力支持與指導，
ZW02n0000_p0063a10_##不可能做好這項工作。因此，我們正在爭取成立一個「中華大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0063a11_##研究會」，希望以此作為學術後援，起到學術顧問的作用。
ZW02n0000_p0063a12_##<p,0,2>由於上面所述的《中華大藏經》下編計劃十分龐大，沒有充足
ZW02n0000_p0063a13_##的財力，充分的準備，不能輕易上馬。因此，我們在中國佛教文化
ZW02n0000_p0063a14_##研究所等有關單位的支持下，先辦了一個《藏外佛教文獻》，我們的
ZW02n0000_p0063a15_##想法是在目前條件下，能夠做多少事，就儘量先去做。以後條件成
ZW02n0000_p0063a16_##熟了，這些經過整理的藏外佛教文獻就可以收入《中華大藏經》下
ZW02n0000_p0063a17_##編。即使我們的《中華大藏經》下編由於種種原因不能上馬，我們
ZW02n0000_p0063a18_##整理的資料也可以為其他人編纂大藏經所用。大藏經的編纂是民
ZW02n0000_p0063a19_##族之大事，世代之大事。吳立民先生說「功成不必在我」。我十分
ZW02n0000_p0063a20_##贊同這一觀點。
ZW02n0000_p0063a21_##<p,0,2>編輯大藏，澤被千秋。但茲事體大，談何容易。不過，既然利
ZW02n0000_p0063a22_##國利民，則即使我們這一代沒有條件實現，後代也會進行。所以，
ZW02n0000_p0063a23_##我現在的想法是：祇要抱著祇講耕耘，不問收穫的心情，盡自己的
ZW02n0000_p0063a24_##力量，能做多少，就做多少，自然功不唐捐，事不虛拋。歸根結底，
ZW02n0000_p0063a25_##一打方案，不如一步實際行動。話說得再多也沒有用，事情必須一
ZW02n0000_p0063a26_##點一滴地去做。
ZW02n0000_p0063a27_##<p,0,2>當然，我更加殷切地希望當代中國佛教界、學術界團結起來，
ZW02n0000_p0063a28_##勇於面對歷史賦予我們的責任，承擔起這一偉大的事業。

ZW02n0000_p0064a07Q3#概述
ZW02n0000_p0064a08_##<p,0,2>將古代典籍錄入電子計算機，採用光盤、磁盤等介質加以儲
ZW02n0000_p0064a09_##存，是現代科技提供的一個優越的技術手段，可以大大提高典籍文
ZW02n0000_p0064a10_##獻的查詢檢索速度，提高資料使用效率，簡化資料的收藏保管工
ZW02n0000_p0064a11_##作。對於[象>像]中文大藏經這樣篇幅繁浩、流傳久遠、版本眾多、思想
ZW02n0000_p0064a12_##文化價值極高的大型典籍，尤其需要借助電子計算機這一現代化
ZW02n0000_p0064a13_##的技術手段來整理和存儲。
ZW02n0000_p0064a14_##<p,0,2>製作中文大藏經電子文庫，是工作量很浩大的一項系統工程，
ZW02n0000_p0064a15_##大致要經過版本搜集、文字整理、軟件開發、人員培訓、器材採購、
ZW02n0000_p0064a16_##數據圖形錄入、後期製作測試和出版發行等工作環節。不僅要解
ZW02n0000_p0064a17_##決技術問題，還要進行大量的編輯、錄入、校對等工作，需要將文獻
ZW02n0000_p0064a18_##專家、文字編輯人員、系統管理專家、計算機工程技術人員、錄入校
ZW02n0000_p0064a19_##對人員等，組織在一起，通力合作，要有較長期工作的心理準備。
ZW02n0000_p0064a20_##<p,0,2>總之，此項工作首先是一項功在歷史、利在大眾的文化事業。同
ZW02n0000_p0064a21_##時，從純投資的角度來考察，又是一項工程週期長，投入強度大，不

ZW02n0000_p0064a23_##項目。
ZW02n0000_p0064a24_##
ZW02n0000_p0064a25Q3#一、文庫集成
ZW02n0000_p0064a26_##<p,0,2>藏經是佛教典籍的總稱，成書的時間跨度大，撰寫、抄錄、翻譯
ZW02n0000_p0064a27_##的人員多，經歷長期的歷史變遷，形成眾多的版本。載體有木板、
ZW02n0000_p0065a01_##碑刻本、手抄本、木刻板等。製作大藏經電子文庫應該不拘泥於某
ZW02n0000_p0065a02_##一個既成版本，儘可能將各種版本搜集齊全，進行必要的勘校整
ZW02n0000_p0065a03_##理，同時還收進晚近佛學新的思想成果，成為一個超越歷史版本的
ZW02n0000_p0065a04_##新集合，成為一個可以不斷擴充的開放系統。
ZW02n0000_p0065a05_##<p,0,2>在工程目標上，要訂一個階段工作目標和工程方案，分期分批
ZW02n0000_p0065a06_##錄入計算機。並建立統一的目錄索引，以便今後查找和使用。我
ZW02n0000_p0065a07_##們這裡先考慮按一個兩年期的首期工作目標來設計。
ZW02n0000_p0065a08_##
ZW02n0000_p0065a09Q3#二、文字整理
ZW02n0000_p0065a10_##<p,0,2>文字整理要結合電子出版物的特點，把那些意義完全相同的
ZW02n0000_p0065a11_##異體字、錯筆字等進行歸一處理，以減少編碼和錄入方面的麻煩
ZW02n0000_p0065a12_##（在必要時，還可以配合圖形存儲方式來完整反映原文原貌）。這
ZW02n0000_p0065a13_##項工作學術性很強，需要慎重對待，但又不能在枝節問題上糾纏不
ZW02n0000_p0065a14_##清，以免影響後續工作的開展。
ZW02n0000_p0065a15_##
ZW02n0000_p0065a16Q3#三、軟件開發
ZW02n0000_p0065a17_##<p,0,2>製作大藏經電子文庫，沒有完整現成的軟件可供使用，需要組
ZW02n0000_p0065a18_##織力量進行開發。涉及的主要技術問題包括字符認定編碼、錄入
ZW02n0000_p0065a19_##方法載入、字形製作、文本管理、排版、圖形製作、多種查詢檢索、顯
ZW02n0000_p0065a20_##示打印等，下面重點就技術方案進行討論。
ZW02n0000_p0065a21_##<p,0,2>1.中文平臺
ZW02n0000_p0065a22_##<p,0,2>作為一個電子出版物，應該具備在多種軟、硬件平臺上使用的
ZW02n0000_p0065a23_##性能，纔可能獲得廣泛的應用。由於電子版大藏經的使用對象主
ZW02n0000_p0065a24_##要是國內外研究人員、佛教僧俗學者、出版機構、圖書館等，所以首
ZW02n0000_p0065a25_##先要考慮在各種流行的PC機和網絡上使用，如DOS，
ZW02n0000_p0065a26_##WINDOWS，MAC OS，UNIX等。中文環境要能支持較大的漢字
ZW02n0000_p0065a27_##字符集，並具備相應的中文輸入方法和打印字庫。佛經典籍主要
ZW02n0000_p0065a28_##是用繁體字寫成的，其中也包括個別現在使用的簡體字，冷僻字比
ZW02n0000_p0066a01_##較多，平臺上應該有較大的補字空間。同時，還要考慮國際文化交
ZW02n0000_p0066a02_##流的需要，因此，應採用ISO-10646編碼標準。ISO-10646是一
ZW02n0000_p0066a03_##個多語種的計算機國際標準編碼體系，其正則方式的編碼容量超
ZW02n0000_p0066a04_##過一千六百萬字符，在基本平面上已定義20902個漢字（被稱為
ZW02n0000_p0066a05_##CJK字符集），並正在醞釀再增九千字左右。在基本平面上若不考
ZW02n0000_p0066a06_##慮其它語種，還可以有三萬字以上的補字空間。這是一個得到各
ZW02n0000_p0066a07_##國承認，有廣泛發展前途的編碼體系。世界各主要計算機公司正
ZW02n0000_p0066a08_##陸續宣佈其產品支持ISO-10646或Unicode（二者在基本平面上
ZW02n0000_p0066a09_##對齊）。例如，微軟公司的Windows95的中文版已於3月中旬發
ZW02n0000_p0066a10_##表，這是一個32位中文操作系統，可以支持Unicode中的CJK中
ZW02n0000_p0066a11_##文字符集，並有相應的輸入法和字形。但是，Windows95要求機檔
ZW02n0000_p0066a12_##高，設備投資及消耗件將成倍增加，且錄入顯示速度慢，輸入方法
ZW02n0000_p0066a13_##（鄭碼）的重碼率也較高。基於以上原因，在錄入工作階段，宜自行
ZW02n0000_p0066a14_##開發一個專門為錄入工作設計的DOS版本的中文平臺和字處理
ZW02n0000_p0066a15_##器。中文編碼應支持ISO-10646，採用全雙字節方式，能完成基
ZW02n0000_p0066a16_##本的錄入編輯工作，同時，又能產生與中文版Windows95和其它
ZW02n0000_p0066a17_##產品平臺上的CJK編碼一致的文本、文件。
ZW02n0000_p0066a18_##<p,0,2>2.輸入方法
ZW02n0000_p0066a19_##<p,0,2>首先要求能支持CJK大字符集，且易學、速度快，目前可選的
ZW02n0000_p0066a20_##祇有鄭碼和倉頡兩種。由於使用倉頡基本不用付費（作者放棄版
ZW02n0000_p0066a21_##權），重碼率也很低，易學易用，故在製作期間可以不考慮費用。將
ZW02n0000_p0066a22_##來在最終出版物產品上使用倉頡碼和拼音，以減少銷售成本。
ZW02n0000_p0066a23_##<p,0,2>3.字形製作
ZW02n0000_p0066a24_##<p,0,2>在DOS版專用平台上，顯示用字採取點陣字，因為繁體字筆
ZW02n0000_p0066a25_##畫較多，故以採用24×24點陣表達較為清楚。打印字庫則要採用
ZW02n0000_p0066a26_##三次曲線字。
ZW02n0000_p0066a27_##<p,0,2>補字是一個工作量較大的工作，在錄入正文時，會不斷發現原
ZW02n0000_p0066a28_##有字符集未收錄的冷僻字。對這些字，要按照相同的編碼方式，在
ZW02n0000_p0067a01_##專門平臺和產品平臺上增補字庫。既要補點陣字，也要補Truetype
ZW02n0000_p0067a02_##字，還要補三次曲線字。
ZW02n0000_p0067a03_##<p,0,2>4.文本管理
ZW02n0000_p0067a04_##<p,0,2>文本管理有兩方面的需要。一是在錄入製作期間，要有一、二
ZW02n0000_p0067a05_##個適用的文本管理軟件對錄入的數據進行管理和處理。二是在製
ZW02n0000_p0067a06_##成品（光盤）上，有一個閱讀器，能方便地閱讀光盤的任何部分，可
ZW02n0000_p0067a07_##以打印輸出。在同一界面下，還能進行查詢、檢索等處理。
ZW02n0000_p0067a08_##<p,0,2>5.查詢、檢索
ZW02n0000_p0067a09_##<p,0,2>用於中文全文檢索的軟件已有五、六種之多，但還未有針對
ZW02n0000_p0067a10_##CJK字符的專用產品，對於海量文本的處理也未盡如人意。檢索
ZW02n0000_p0067a11_##查詢及統計功能對於電子版的書籍是必不可少的功能，對此我們
ZW02n0000_p0067a12_##已有相當的技術準備，可以開發出與整個產品緊密結合的專用檢
ZW02n0000_p0067a13_##索軟件。
ZW02n0000_p0067a14_##<p,0,2>6.排版
ZW02n0000_p0067a15_##<p,0,2>大藏經的版式，可搞成橫排和豎排兩種版本。數據錄入校對
ZW02n0000_p0067a16_##完畢之後，除去製作光盤產品，還可以交出版社印製分冊成書，供
ZW02n0000_p0067a17_##寺院作法物流通之用。
ZW02n0000_p0067a18_##<p,0,2>7.多媒體功能
ZW02n0000_p0067a19_##<p,0,2>由於每張光盤有近600M的存儲容量，除了文本內容外，還可
ZW02n0000_p0067a20_##以加入圖片、聲音等信息，如讀音、照片等。採用多媒體技術，可以
ZW02n0000_p0067a21_##豐富電子版圖書表達的內容，充分發揮電子計算機的優越性。
ZW02n0000_p0067a22_##
ZW02n0000_p0067a23Q3#四、人員培訓
ZW02n0000_p0067a24_##<p,0,2>參與錄入階段工作的編輯、打字、校對人員需要百餘人。所有
ZW02n0000_p0067a25_##人員必須具備相當的文字知識，特別是對異體字有相當瞭解，打字
ZW02n0000_p0067a26_##人員還要學會倉頡輸入法。這樣的人員祇能通過招募培訓的方式
ZW02n0000_p0067a27_##解決。新進人員首先要有不少於一個月的培訓期，待其在打字錄
ZW02n0000_p0067a28_##入方面能盲打並達到30字/分的速度以上纔能上崗。至於文字知
ZW02n0000_p0068a01_##識，則需定期培訓。考慮到人員合理的流動，培訓工作必須是連續
ZW02n0000_p0068a02_##不斷的，並有專職人員負責。
ZW02n0000_p0068a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0068a04Q3#五、數據整理、後期加工製作、測試
ZW02n0000_p0068a05_##<p,0,2>文字、圖形、聲音等各種資料錄入之後，要進行必要的處理，壓
ZW02n0000_p0068a06_##縮存儲，搭配必要的軟件，刻入光盤，然後還要進行比較全面的測
ZW02n0000_p0068a07_##試、修改，以保證電子文庫大藏經的質量和可靠性。
ZW02n0000_p0068a08_##
ZW02n0000_p0068a09Q3#六、時間安排
ZW02n0000_p0068a10_##<p,0,2>初步安排為兩年時間，列表如下：

ZW02n0000_p0071a03A##王志遠
ZW02n0000_p0071a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0071a05_##<p,0,2>欣逢盛世，國勢日強。在物質文明日益發達之際，精神文明的
ZW02n0000_p0071a06_##建設必須高度重視，這已成為黨內外的普遍共識。為弘揚愛國主
ZW02n0000_p0071a07_##義精神，加強精神文明建設，光大民族文化遺產，適應時代發展需
ZW02n0000_p0071a08_##要，團結海內外炎黃子孫，促進祖國統一大業，中國學者議論已久
ZW02n0000_p0071a09_##的是希望能建立電腦化大藏經工程，以迎接21世紀中華民族的偉
ZW02n0000_p0071a10_##大復興。
ZW02n0000_p0071a11_##<p,0,2>一、大藏經工程是民族文化的跨世紀工程
ZW02n0000_p0071a12_##<p,0,2>「大藏經」的編纂是中國人的創舉，它繼承了印度佛教典籍的
ZW02n0000_p0071a13_##結集優良傳統，同規起步，而又發揚光大，是人類文化史上的盛事，
ZW02n0000_p0071a14_##對中國文化和世界文化都已發生了深遠影響。佛教自從兩漢之際
ZW02n0000_p0071a15_##傳入中國以來，逐步形成了濃郁的中國特色。隋唐之後，由中央政
ZW02n0000_p0071a16_##府敕命修藏，成為國家文治的重大舉措之一。北宋始創刊印官版
ZW02n0000_p0071a17_##《開寶藏》，其後遼、金、元、明、清歷代都有由政府主持編纂的大藏
ZW02n0000_p0071a18_##經問世，其內容涉及宗教、歷史、文學、藝術、哲學、音樂、繪畫、建築
ZW02n0000_p0071a19_##等各個領域，涵蓋廣泛，蘊含豐富，迄今已成為無價瑰寶，世界級的
ZW02n0000_p0071a20_##文化遺產。
ZW02n0000_p0071a21_##<p,0,2>作為人類共有的文化遺產，捷足先登已成慣例。從19世紀末
ZW02n0000_p0071a22_##到20世紀初，正當中國人民在列強欺凌之苦，軍閥混戰之亂中掙
ZW02n0000_p0071a23_##扎奮鬥的時候，日本從明治時代開始，先後四次纂修漢文大藏經，
ZW02n0000_p0071a24_##其中以大正時代開始編纂的《大正新修大藏經》（1925～1932）最為
ZW02n0000_p0071a25_##著名，煌煌百冊，計3360部，13520卷，迄今已流通六十餘年。世
ZW02n0000_p0071a26_##人皆知佛教之慧命本在中國，但當代佛教之大藏卻由日本人編纂
ZW02n0000_p0071a27_##流通，包括中國學者、中國佛教徒在內，多年來日常應用的，仍不得
ZW02n0000_p0072a01_##不是日本《大正大藏經》。日方除佔據文化優勢之外，從版權收益
ZW02n0000_p0072a02_##方面來講，也佔足了中國文化遺產的好處。日本人謂為發了「文化
ZW02n0000_p0072a03_##財」。本世紀上半葉的中國學者曾為此感慨萬端，然而國運如彼，
ZW02n0000_p0072a04_##民生如彼，何處去談大藏經文化！
ZW02n0000_p0072a05_##<p,0,2>1956年，隅居臺灣的蔣介石為自標正統，曾親自捐款支持纂
ZW02n0000_p0072a06_##修了一部《中華大藏經》，但基本仍是影印本，進展緩慢。蔣介石去
ZW02n0000_p0072a07_##世後一度停頓，後由臺灣當局出面維持，到1982年草草收場，並未
ZW02n0000_p0072a08_##達到預期目的。
ZW02n0000_p0072a09_##<p,0,2>而今，百年荏苒，又值世紀之交，但中國已非百年前之中國，政
ZW02n0000_p0072a10_##府亦非百年前之政府，百年前失去的優勢，今日不收回，更待何日？
ZW02n0000_p0072a11_##臺灣地方政府無法實現的修藏大業，我們一定能實現。當代的中
ZW02n0000_p0072a12_##國政府、中國學者、中國佛教徒，一定有能力編纂一部最全面最完
ZW02n0000_p0072a13_##美最具權威性的大藏經，上以對歷代先祖先賢，下以對後代子子孫
ZW02n0000_p0072a14_##孫，發行五洲，流通四海，傳我文化，揚我國威。這是民族文化振興
ZW02n0000_p0072a15_##偉業之一部分，這是民族文化建設之跨世紀宏偉工程。
ZW02n0000_p0072a16_##<p,0,2>二、大藏經工程是電腦時代奪取知識產權制高點的戰略措施
ZW02n0000_p0072a17_##<p,0,2>21世紀即將到來，電腦將成為下一個世紀中最富挑戰性的變
ZW02n0000_p0072a18_##革力量之一。電腦與知識產權的結合，將制約社會活動的各個領
ZW02n0000_p0072a19_##域。目前，世界電腦網絡高速公路上運行的主要是西方文化，而東
ZW02n0000_p0072a20_##方文化，特別是漢字文化，尚且不能佔據重要位置。大藏經工程是
ZW02n0000_p0072a21_##改變這一狀況的有力措施。初步估算，大藏經工程將錄入三億多
ZW02n0000_p0072a22_##漢字，涉及的相關資料更遠遠超過三億之數。由於佛教雖源於東
ZW02n0000_p0072a23_##方卻已遍及世界，因此電腦化的大藏經工程，將得到世界範圍的接
ZW02n0000_p0072a24_##受。在這個認同的過程中，漢字文化的廣泛傳播問題迎刃而解，而
ZW02n0000_p0072a25_##我們也同時爭取到大藏經遺產的電腦化知識產權所有權，為子孫
ZW02n0000_p0072a26_##後代留下一份主動。
ZW02n0000_p0072a27_##<p,0,2>就大藏經本身而言，日本《大正大藏經》雖已流通六十餘年，但
ZW02n0000_p0072a28_##由於日本人對漢文化的掌握畢竟有隔膜之處，因此標點錯誤比比
ZW02n0000_p0073a01_##皆是，遺漏著作纍纍可見。我們現在站在中國佛教漢傳、藏傳、南
ZW02n0000_p0073a02_##傳三系俱全的立場重新編纂，一定能以21世紀應有的高度超過
ZW02n0000_p0073a03_##《大正藏》，取代《大正藏》在全球的流通地位。
ZW02n0000_p0073a04_##<p,0,2>自80年代起，中華書局曾陸續出版《中華大藏經》，是以《趙城
ZW02n0000_p0073a05_##金藏》為主要底本影印的。在保存古典原貌方面，這套書做出了貢
ZW02n0000_p0073a06_##獻。但與大藏經工程相比，後者更具時代性、應用性、全面性，因而
ZW02n0000_p0073a07_##也更具權威性。由於大藏經工程首先是電腦化的開放體系，是一
ZW02n0000_p0073a08_##座無所不包的數據庫，所以它可以為政府管理、學者研究、教徒供
ZW02n0000_p0073a09_##奉等各種需求提供全方位的多種版本的服務，這種服務所獲得的
ZW02n0000_p0073a10_##社會效益和經濟效益都將是巨大而長久的。
ZW02n0000_p0073a11_##<p,0,2>目前，在大藏經電腦化方面，國際間競爭激烈，我們必須捉住
ZW02n0000_p0073a12_##機遇，迎頭趕上。如果失去機遇，我們會愧對先賢留下的遺產，愧
ZW02n0000_p0073a13_##對子孫寄予我們的期望。
ZW02n0000_p0073a14_##<p,0,2>三、大藏經工程在增強中華民族凝聚力和促進海峽兩岸統一
ZW02n0000_p0073a15_##等方面將產生深遠影響
ZW02n0000_p0073a16_##<p,0,2>大藏經工程首先是一項文化大業，通過編纂工作，將從佛教文
ZW02n0000_p0073a17_##化角度對中華傳統文化做一次深入的挖掘整理，將從佛學、史學、
ZW02n0000_p0073a18_##文學、哲學、政治學、社會學、經濟學以及繪畫、雕塑、書法、音樂、建
ZW02n0000_p0073a19_##築等諸多門類發現有助於當前精神文明建設的積極因素。
ZW02n0000_p0073a20_##<p,0,2>除此之外，在其他方面，特別是統戰工作、宗教導向和培育人
ZW02n0000_p0073a21_##材等方面的影響也將是深遠的。
ZW02n0000_p0073a22_##<p,0,2>1.在世界範圍裡，大藏經工程可以成為最容易取得幾乎全部
ZW02n0000_p0073a23_##華人認同支持的一項共同事業，其號召力將在華人世界中得到巨
ZW02n0000_p0073a24_##大反響，使世界各地華人動員起來，在人力、物力、財力諸方面隨喜
ZW02n0000_p0073a25_##功德。除人力、財力的無償支持之外，如果能使散在世界的許多珍
ZW02n0000_p0073a26_##貴典籍版本重返故國，也將成為學術界、佛教界的大幸。大藏經工
ZW02n0000_p0073a27_##程將成為世界華人心繫祖國的一座特殊的橋樑。
ZW02n0000_p0073a28_##<p,0,2>2.大藏經工程將得到臺灣學術界、宗教界及其他各界佛教徒
ZW02n0000_p0074a01_##的支持，將成為海峽兩岸共同協作的一個範例，會有力地推動統一
ZW02n0000_p0074a02_##大業。臺灣人口中，目前佛教徒占60%以上，大藏經工程將吸引
ZW02n0000_p0074a03_##他們心向大陸，提供人力、物力、財力的巨大支持。
ZW02n0000_p0074a04_##<p,0,2>3.大藏經工程也是中華民族團結的象徵。在大藏經工程中，
ZW02n0000_p0074a05_##將包括藏文、傣文經典的漢譯文本，這是幾千年來前所未有的中華
ZW02n0000_p0074a06_##佛教三系一體的宏偉構劃。少數民族的文化受到尊重，中華民族
ZW02n0000_p0074a07_##的文化得到豐富。
ZW02n0000_p0074a08_##<p,0,2>4.大藏經工程將促進政府職能部門、學術界、科技界和宗教
ZW02n0000_p0074a09_##界的相互理解和協作，使各部門、各界在同一目標的導引下增強凝
ZW02n0000_p0074a10_##聚力。
ZW02n0000_p0074a11_##<p,0,2>5.大藏經工程是對佛教發展的正確引導。通過編纂大藏經，
ZW02n0000_p0074a12_##可以培養出一批精通佛法的學者專家；可以培養出一批高僧大德、
ZW02n0000_p0074a13_##佛門龍象，使佛教後繼有人。佛教應提倡重義理、簡禮懺，大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0074a14_##工程是實踐這種文化導向的重要方式。
ZW02n0000_p0074a15_##<p,0,2>四、幾點建議
ZW02n0000_p0074a16_##<p,0,2>1.大藏經工程應由國家立項，國家領導人領銜，民間團體（如
ZW02n0000_p0074a17_##中國佛教協會、中國宗教學會、綜合開發研究院等）主辦，國務院宗
ZW02n0000_p0074a18_##教事務局監修，國家科研部門或大專院校（如中國社科院世界宗教
ZW02n0000_p0074a19_##研究所、北京大學、人民大學、中國佛教文化研究所等）參與實施，
ZW02n0000_p0074a20_##並利用老一輩專家學者尚健在的寶貴時間，發揮他們的學術帶頭
ZW02n0000_p0074a21_##作用。
ZW02n0000_p0074a22_##<p,0,2>2.大藏經工程應成立專門的纂修募捐委員會，向海內外華人
ZW02n0000_p0074a23_##發出呼籲，並負責專門的募捐、管理工作。
ZW02n0000_p0074a24_##<p,0,2>3.為保障大藏經工程在十年左右的時間裡基本完成，可以按
ZW02n0000_p0074a25_##四、三、三的時間段落安排進程。第一段四年，以收集版本、錄入各
ZW02n0000_p0074a26_##種著述及音像資料為主，同時報請國家教委批准，在北京大學、中
ZW02n0000_p0074a27_##央民族大學和中國佛學院各開設一個「大藏經工程專業本科班」作
ZW02n0000_p0074a28_##為工程的基本力量，在學者專家的指導下邊學邊[干>幹]。第二段三年，
ZW02n0000_p0075a01_##以分類分段標點校勘整理為主，同時在原本科班大學畢業生中選
ZW02n0000_p0075a02_##拔一半進入碩士學習階段，成為大藏經工程的骨[干>幹]力量。第三段
ZW02n0000_p0075a03_##三年，仍以分類分段標點校勘整理為主，同時在碩士畢業生中選拔
ZW02n0000_p0075a04_##一半進入博士學習階段，培養目標是成為某宗某系的專家，為完善
ZW02n0000_p0075a05_##大藏經工程進而開發利用，分擔領導實施的責任。這批人才將成
ZW02n0000_p0075a06_##為功底深厚的跨世紀人才，將在21世紀發揮重要作用。
ZW02n0000_p0075a07_##<p,0,2>總之，盛世修藏，眾心所向。大藏經工程作為民族文化的跨世
ZW02n0000_p0075a08_##紀工程，作為電腦時代奪取知識產權制高點的戰略措施，作為增強
ZW02n0000_p0075a09_##中華民族凝聚力、促進海峽兩岸統一的宏偉的文化大業，必將為統
ZW02n0000_p0075a10_##戰工作和精神文明建設做出積極的貢獻。功在當代，利在千秋。
ZW02n0000_p0075a11_##祇祇要有黨和政府的英明領導，民間團體的發心誠意，全世界華人的
ZW02n0000_p0075a12_##同心贊助和海內外學者的通力協作，一批跨世紀的優秀人才就一

ZW02n0000_p0076a08_##<p,0,2>1.現在，全世界每天都有數萬乃至數十萬的新用戶進入Internet
ZW02n0000_p0076a09_##（國際互聯網），每時、每分、每秒在Internet上進行著海量信
ZW02n0000_p0076a10_##息交換的，除了經濟、科技信息和社會新聞外，還有著大量的思想
ZW02n0000_p0076a11_##文化信息產品，如資料、文獻、論文、著作、典籍等等。Internet事
ZW02n0000_p0076a12_##實上已經成為一個突破了現有規制方式的巨大世界思想文化交流
ZW02n0000_p0076a13_##網。但是，打開網絡瀏覽就會發現，西文信息，西方文化資訊產品
ZW02n0000_p0076a14_##主導了這個網絡，偏少的漢字文獻信息基本上是港、臺、日、韓發佈
ZW02n0000_p0076a15_##的，大陸的東西少得可憐。古人類文明史上，曾有一些文明、文化
ZW02n0000_p0076a16_##萎縮、衰落、被淘汰出局，其重要原因，就是因為其封閉或者被封
ZW02n0000_p0076a17_##閉，無法與外部世界保持正常的交流以不斷地獲取新的活力，從而
ZW02n0000_p0076a18_##逐漸走入了「死寂」狀態。
ZW02n0000_p0076a19_##<p,0,2>「對外開放」是中國近十六、七年來得以持續、快速發展的成功
ZW02n0000_p0076a20_##國策之一。現在，應該用信息時代的理念來理解、設計和運作這一
ZW02n0000_p0076a21_##國策。
ZW02n0000_p0076a22_##<p,0,2>2.從技術的角度來看，信息高速公路中的網絡相當於公路，
ZW02n0000_p0076a23_##掛在網絡上的計算機硬件設備和系統軟件相當於運載信息貨物的
ZW02n0000_p0076a24_##汽車。必須承認，修公路，製造汽車的技術和產業實力控制在西方
ZW02n0000_p0076a25_##國家少數幾個大型跨國公司手中，我們尚有相當的差距。但是，路
ZW02n0000_p0076a26_##和車都是為運輸的貨物——信息服務的。貨主——信息源的掌握
ZW02n0000_p0076a27_##者在網上還是可以居主導地位的。如果我們有遠見地積極將中華
ZW02n0000_p0077a01_##民族歷數千年歷史的傳承、交流和不斷發展的思想文化成果進行
ZW02n0000_p0077a02_##數字化處理，成為可在網絡中供多種用途的資訊產品，我們就成為
ZW02n0000_p0077a03_##信息高速公路為之服務的最大貸主之一，我們就可在Internet的
ZW02n0000_p0077a04_##及今後新崛起來的更高級網絡上據有主動的地位，中華文明就具
ZW02n0000_p0077a05_##備了歷久彌新、弘揚世界的現代化條件。
ZW02n0000_p0077a06_##
ZW02n0000_p0077a07Q2#二、來自新經濟增長理論的啟示
ZW02n0000_p0077a08_##<p,0,2>新經濟增長理論認為，在信息時代，知識產權的價值，對國民
ZW02n0000_p0077a09_##經濟的貢獻將超過以往任何時代，將成為可以流動、套現的重要財
ZW02n0000_p0077a10_##富。而知識產品，往往是在全新的理論和創新的概念支持下，用浩
ZW02n0000_p0077a11_##大的研究、開發費用實現的，一旦成型，直接生產成本反而低廉，其
ZW02n0000_p0077a12_##商業價值中，創新及研發費用佔了十之七、八甚至更高，這就是知
ZW02n0000_p0077a13_##識產權的價值所在。對知識產權的競爭將會像爭奪資源一樣激
ZW02n0000_p0077a14_##烈。體現數千年中華文明的古典文獻、藝術品、文物被數字化處理
ZW02n0000_p0077a15_##後，將是商業價值極高的資訊產品，我們自己不掌握這類資訊產品
ZW02n0000_p0077a16_##的知識產權，就會被境外實業界或者社團搶先掌握。
ZW02n0000_p0077a17_##
ZW02n0000_p0077a18Q2#三、用電腦製作大藏經電子文庫的意義
ZW02n0000_p0077a19_##<p,0,2>1.用電腦製作大藏經電子文庫，實際上就是運用已經成熟的
ZW02n0000_p0077a20_##電腦文字和圖形處理技術，將傳統的石刻本、木刻本、書冊本的典
ZW02n0000_p0077a21_##籍文獻進行數字化處理，做成可以方便地貯存在軟、硬磁盤及光碟
ZW02n0000_p0077a22_##上的標準化電腦文件，再配之以一系列方便實用的工具軟件，集合
ZW02n0000_p0077a23_##成一個標準的、開放性的數據庫。這個數據庫可以掛在網絡上，為
ZW02n0000_p0077a24_##專家學者以及廣大愛好者、信仰者閱讀、檢索、研究之用。也可為
ZW02n0000_p0077a25_##多種形式的出版物，如書冊本、磁碟版、多媒體光碟版提供強有力
ZW02n0000_p0077a26_##的基礎性支持。
ZW02n0000_p0077a27_##<p,0,2>過去，出版珍貴的大型古籍文獻，特別是藏經，由於傳統出版
ZW02n0000_p0077a28_##物的[制板>製版]及維護成本非常昂貴，在正式[制板>製版]之前必須使稿本儘可
ZW02n0000_p0078a01_##能盡善盡美，而典籍文獻的集成、校勘、點註除了工作量巨大外，本
ZW02n0000_p0078a02_##身還存在一個見仁見智難以統一的學術觀點問題。所以總是爭論
ZW02n0000_p0078a03_##不休，主事者也無法調適眾口。大多數書冊本出版後，常常因為集
ZW02n0000_p0078a04_##中性的批評校正意見而不得不在再版時又作費力費時費錢的挖補
ZW02n0000_p0078a05_##修改。建了基礎性的電子文庫後，這類問題就可以方便地解決了。
ZW02n0000_p0078a06_##譬如，可以在正式製作書冊本之前，出多種見仁見智的磁盤本（磁
ZW02n0000_p0078a07_##盤成本極低）廣泛徵詢意見，然後再集合成書冊本的電子底本。
ZW02n0000_p0078a08_##<p,0,2>2.電子文庫實際上在方法論上為典籍文獻的整理出版提供
ZW02n0000_p0078a09_##了一個全新的視野：
ZW02n0000_p0078a10_##<p,0,2>（1）它是一個開放性的，可以不斷修改，不斷擴充的集合。
ZW02n0000_p0078a11_##<p,0,2>（2）它可以將恆久性的終極目標與階段性的工作目標較好地統
ZW02n0000_p0078a12_##一起來。譬如，將認同度高的選本先期錄入、點校、發佈、出版，逐
ZW02n0000_p0078a13_##漸遞進完備。
ZW02n0000_p0078a14_##<p,0,2>（3）可以提供一個廣泛參與的機會，持別是在大藏經電子文庫
ZW02n0000_p0078a15_##的錄入、校對、斷句和出版工作中，有利於對廣大信仰者作提昇素
ZW02n0000_p0078a16_##養的文化導向工作。
ZW02n0000_p0078a17_##<p,0,2>（4）可以方便地參與國際文化交流。
ZW02n0000_p0078a18_##<p,0,2>（5）製作費用和耗時可大大節省。

ZW02n0000_p0079a02Q2#日本近代以來的大藏經編印事業
ZW02n0000_p0079a03A##楊曾文
ZW02n0000_p0079a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0079a05_##<p,0,2>現在中國要不要編纂一部新的大藏經？能不能調集勝任的學
ZW02n0000_p0079a06_##者和多方面的人力，籌備到雄厚的財力開始大藏經的編纂工程？
ZW02n0000_p0079a07_##如果著手編纂，要編纂一部怎樣的大藏經？在大藏經編纂完成後，
ZW02n0000_p0079a08_##如何組織學者和其他專門人才把它輸入電腦，製成便於人們閱讀
ZW02n0000_p0079a09_##和使用的軟件或光盤？對這些問題確實應當加以認真思考，深入
ZW02n0000_p0079a10_##探討。因此，我對於國務院宗教事務局領導舉辦這個研討會是表
ZW02n0000_p0079a11_##示十分贊成的。
ZW02n0000_p0079a12_##<p,0,2>這裡，我想把我瞭解的日本在進入近代以後編印大藏經的事
ZW02n0000_p0079a13_##業略作介紹，希望供我們研究編纂大藏經問題時參考。
ZW02n0000_p0079a14_##<p,0,2>日本進入近代以後為保護文化遺產和適應研究與傳教的需
ZW02n0000_p0079a15_##要，先後編纂了幾部大藏經，不僅流行國內，有的也被國際學術界
ZW02n0000_p0079a16_##普遍使用。
ZW02n0000_p0079a17_##<p,0,2>（1）《大日本校訂大藏經》（《縮刷藏》）
ZW02n0000_p0079a18_##<p,0,2>這是日本首次用金屬活字印刷的大藏經。天台宗的島田蕃根
ZW02n0000_p0079a19_##與淨淨土宗增上寺福田行誡設立弘教書院從事編纂工作，從1880年
ZW02n0000_p0079a20_##到1885年完成，用小型5號活字印刷，裝潢採取線裝本，共有40
ZW02n0000_p0079a21_##帙418冊，另有目錄一冊。此藏以東京增上寺所藏的《高麗藏》為
ZW02n0000_p0079a22_##底本，並以宋《思溪藏》（簡稱宋藏）、元《普寧藏》（簡稱元藏）、明《嘉
ZW02n0000_p0079a23_##興藏》（簡稱明藏，一般用日本翻印此藏的《黃檗藏》代替）校之，在
ZW02n0000_p0079a24_##經文的上方（天頭）印有註明各本異同的校註。編排方法對傳統的
ZW02n0000_p0079a25_##大藏經（按《開元釋教錄》的入藏錄）有所突破，採取明僧智旭《閱藏
ZW02n0000_p0079a26_##知津》的編錄主張，對大乘佛經不再以般若、寶積、大集、華嚴、涅槃
ZW02n0000_p0079a27_##五部分類，而據天台宗的「五時」判教次序，以華嚴、方等、般若、法
ZW02n0000_p0080a01_##華、涅槃五部分類，把原來屬於寶積、大集二部的經典並入方等部，
ZW02n0000_p0080a02_##又單立法華部，並把它放到涅槃部之前。在「雜藏」部分主要是中
ZW02n0000_p0080a03_##國撰述，也有一小部分是日本撰述。此藏以校訂精審著稱。它的
ZW02n0000_p0080a04_##出版對日本近代佛教研究提供很大方便。此藏很快被傳到中國，
ZW02n0000_p0080a05_##1911年到1914年由上海頻伽精舍用此藏為底本，用4號活字翻
ZW02n0000_p0080a06_##印為《頻伽精舍校刊大藏經》（《頻伽藏》），裝訂為40函414冊，但
ZW02n0000_p0080a07_##去掉了原「日本撰述部」的一部分，並且把很有價值的頁上的校註
ZW02n0000_p0080a08_##也去掉了。
ZW02n0000_p0080a09_##<p,0,2>（2）《日本校訂大藏經》（《卍字藏》）和《大日本續藏經》（《卍字
ZW02n0000_p0080a10_##續藏》）
ZW02n0000_p0080a11_##<p,0,2>從1902年到1905年京都藏經書院出版的《日本校訂大藏經》
ZW02n0000_p0080a12_##是由中野達慧、前田慧雲等人編纂的另一部活字版大藏經，因為封
ZW02n0000_p0080a13_##面印有卍字，故被簡稱《卍字藏》。此藏以江戶時期京都法然院忍
ZW02n0000_p0080a14_##徵用建仁寺所藏《高麗藏》校對過的《黃檗藏》為底本，用4號活字
ZW02n0000_p0080a15_##印刷，每頁分上下兩段，行間加上標點和便於日本人閱讀的訓點，
ZW02n0000_p0080a16_##裝潢採取線裝，共有347冊。
ZW02n0000_p0080a17_##<p,0,2>從1905年到1912年藏經書院又編印了所謂《大日本續藏
ZW02n0000_p0080a18_##經》，簡稱《卍字續藏》。因為過去的大藏經所收編的絕大部分是譯
ZW02n0000_p0080a19_##自印度的佛典，中國撰述部分很少，而以收錄中國佛教撰述為主的
ZW02n0000_p0080a20_##《明續藏》、《明又續藏》已成稀覯之物。此藏則以收編中國佛教著
ZW02n0000_p0080a21_##述為主，並收入少量印度和日本的佛教著述，其中尤其以各宗章疏
ZW02n0000_p0080a22_##和禪宗典籍最多，共收入950餘人的著述1757部7148卷，裝訂為
ZW02n0000_p0080a23_##150套（函）751冊。在此藏的編纂過程中，中國南京金陵刻經處的
ZW02n0000_p0080a24_##創始人楊文會居士曾贈送在中國搜集的若干珍貴佛典。應當指
ZW02n0000_p0080a25_##出，日本藏經書院編纂此藏還有一個政治意圖，即借此紀念日本在
ZW02n0000_p0080a26_##日俄戰爭中的勝利並悼念戰死的日本官兵。這種追隨日本軍國主
ZW02n0000_p0080a27_##義的思想動機與當時日本一部分學者和佛教界人士所表現出來的
ZW02n0000_p0080a28_##反戰或厭戰情緒形成鮮明的對照，不能不使此藏蒙上一層陰影。
ZW02n0000_p0081a01_##<p,0,2>在《大正藏》出版後，《卍字藏》逐漸不很流行，但因為《卍字續
ZW02n0000_p0081a02_##藏》中不僅有很多在中國久佚而在日本僅存的佛典，而且有相當部
ZW02n0000_p0081a03_##分是《大正藏》所未收的典籍，所以至今仍被國際學術界廣泛使用。
ZW02n0000_p0081a04_##上海商務印書館在1920年曾影印了《卍字續藏》。現在臺灣也有
ZW02n0000_p0081a05_##影印本。日本近年由西一雄、玉城康四郎監修，對此藏稍作修訂和
ZW02n0000_p0081a06_##補充，出版了《新纂續藏經》90冊。
ZW02n0000_p0081a07_##<p,0,2>（3）《大正新修大藏經》（《大正藏》）
ZW02n0000_p0081a08_##<p,0,2>這是由高楠順次郎、渡邊海旭擔任監修，有小野玄妙等多位學
ZW02n0000_p0081a09_##者參加，組成的「大正一切經刊行會」編印的規模空前的一部大藏
ZW02n0000_p0081a10_##經。為保證編譯工作的進度和質量，在刊行會之下設立若干個校
ZW02n0000_p0081a11_##訂事務所，還有負責標點加註、編纂排印、編撰索引等工作的機構。
ZW02n0000_p0081a12_##從1922年著手籌畫到1934年最後完成，共用了13年的時間。
ZW02n0000_p0081a13_##<p,0,2>本藏以東京增上寺所藏《高麗藏》為底本，在《縮刷藏》的四本
ZW02n0000_p0081a14_##對校的基礎上，再參照敦煌佛典、日本正倉院和宮內省圖書寮藏經
ZW02n0000_p0081a15_##以及名山古剎與個人所藏的佛典、巴利文經典和近代以後發現的
ZW02n0000_p0081a16_##梵文經典，對所收佛典進行校勘，編錄。編排體例改變以往的大小
ZW02n0000_p0081a17_##乘佛典的分類方法，而基本依據佛典的內容分類。全藏分三大部
ZW02n0000_p0081a18_##分：「正藏」、「續藏」、「別卷」，共100卷（冊），收編佛典3360部
ZW02n0000_p0081a19_##13520卷。其中「正藏」55卷，收編印度經典、中國撰述（僅有極少
ZW02n0000_p0081a20_##量日本、朝鮮人的著作）2184部；印度撰述部分分為經、律、論三大
ZW02n0000_p0081a21_##類，經部按內容並參照佛教發展史分為：阿含、本緣、般若、法華、華
ZW02n0000_p0081a22_##嚴、寶積、涅槃、大集、經集、密教10類。「續藏」30卷，收編日本撰
ZW02n0000_p0081a23_##述和「古逸」（包括敦煌古逸文獻）、「疑似」（疑偽書）二部的著作
ZW02n0000_p0081a24_##736部。「別卷」15卷，其中「圖像部」收編圖像（主要是日本寺院所

ZW02n0000_p0082a09_##<p,0,2>（4）《日本大藏經》、《大日本佛教全書》（《日佛全》）和其它佛教
ZW02n0000_p0082a10_##叢書
ZW02n0000_p0082a11_##<p,0,2>中野達慧在編印完《續藏經》之後，從1914年到1921年在東
ZW02n0000_p0082a12_##京組成「大藏經編纂會」，請京都大學的松本文三郎為會長，著手編
ZW02n0000_p0082a13_##印《日本大藏經》。本藏收錄日本的佛教撰述，分為經藏、律藏、論
ZW02n0000_p0082a14_##藏、宗典四部，共有48冊。圍繞此藏的編纂，村上專精曾與中野進
ZW02n0000_p0082a15_##行學術爭論，村上認為中國歷代編纂大藏經皆由高僧名士奉帝王
ZW02n0000_p0082a16_##之敕進行，對中野主持編纂大藏經頗不以為然，並批評用「日本大
ZW02n0000_p0082a17_##藏經」的名稱是一種「僭越」。此藏因為收有日本佛教史上一些珍
ZW02n0000_p0082a18_##貴文獻，至今仍有使用價值。
ZW02n0000_p0082a19_##<p,0,2>《大日本佛教全書》151冊，由南條文雄、高楠順次郎、大村西
ZW02n0000_p0082a20_##崖、望月信亨等人組成的「佛書刊行會」編印。望月在編纂《佛教大
ZW02n0000_p0082a21_##辭典》中為編書參考曾收集很多佛教文獻。編纂《日佛全》時即以
ZW02n0000_p0082a22_##此為基礎，又搜集其他文獻，然後加以校訂。所收絕大部分是日本
ZW02n0000_p0082a23_##人的撰述，僅有少量中國人的撰述。全書收編經、律、論和註釋書
ZW02n0000_p0082a24_##以及日本各宗的教典、史傳等共953部。其中有多種日本僧傳，還
ZW02n0000_p0082a25_##有「遊方傳叢書」、「寺誌叢書」、高僧日記……不僅對研究日本佛
ZW02n0000_p0082a26_##教，而且對研究日本文學、中日文化交流，都有參考價值。現在此
ZW02n0000_p0082a27_##書有鈴木財團刊印本。
ZW02n0000_p0082a28_##<p,0,2>此外，收錄日本佛教撰述的叢書還有鷲尾順敬在1925年到
ZW02n0000_p0083a01_##1933年編纂的《國文東方佛教叢書》（主要是日文撰述）。日本各
ZW02n0000_p0083a02_##宗都編有叢書，如《天台宗全書》、《傳教大師全集》、《真言宗全書》、

ZW02n0000_p0083a14_##<p,0,2>斯里蘭卡等南傳佛教國家的巴利文佛教典籍叢書，原稱「三
ZW02n0000_p0083a15_##藏」。約在公元前二、一世紀形成此藏原型。內容有律藏；經藏，包
ZW02n0000_p0083a16_##括相當於漢譯四部《阿含經》的《長部》、《中部》、《相應部》、《增支
ZW02n0000_p0083a17_##部》以及《小部》；論藏，相當於漢譯的小乘論書。1882年英國成立

ZW02n0000_p0084a03Q2=一些情況和經驗教訓
ZW02n0000_p0084a04A##李富華
ZW02n0000_p0084a05_##
ZW02n0000_p0084a06_##<p,0,2>一、《中華大藏經》的編輯是建國以來由國家出資，由國務院古
ZW02n0000_p0084a07_##籍小組直接領導，並交由任繼愈同志主持進行的一項佛教典籍整理
ZW02n0000_p0084a08_##的國家項目。1982年7月開始籌備，1994年完成106冊正編，前後
ZW02n0000_p0084a09_##13年時間。13年間，先後直接參加編校工作的人員超過三百人；這
ZW02n0000_p0084a10_##一工作也得到包括北京圖書館、中國佛教協會、北京市佛教協會及
ZW02n0000_p0084a11_##山西省佛教協會等許多單位的大力支持。此書由中華書局出版。
ZW02n0000_p0084a12_##<p,0,2>二、《中華大藏經》編輯班子的核心是由宗教研究所佛教研究室
ZW02n0000_p0084a13_##的部分研究人員組成，並聘請南亞研究所的童瑋先生（已故）參加。
ZW02n0000_p0084a14_##我們的工作大體經過了這樣幾個階段：
ZW02n0000_p0084a15_##<p,0,2>1.調查研究，即對全國範圍內的大藏經收藏情況進行普查。除
ZW02n0000_p0084a16_##北京的各大圖書館和大寺院外，還分幾路走訪了上海、南京、廣西、
ZW02n0000_p0084a17_##福建、江蘇、河北、山西、陝西、甘肅、寧夏、遼寧等地的圖書館、寺院
ZW02n0000_p0084a18_##及博物館等。
ZW02n0000_p0084a19_##<p,0,2>2.抄錄目錄卡片，即將北圖、民族文化宮及各地收集的佛經收
ZW02n0000_p0084a20_##藏情況形成目錄；還將歷代大藏的特有經籍抄成卡片。完成此工作
ZW02n0000_p0084a21_##用時約半年。
ZW02n0000_p0084a22_##<p,0,2>3.根據調查的結果，我們形成了以《趙城金藏》為基礎的重編
ZW02n0000_p0084a23_##《中華大藏經》的編輯方案。這裡要說明一點，即當時曾有過直接影
ZW02n0000_p0084a24_##印《趙城藏》，還是重編大藏經的分歧，我們堅持後一種方案，此方案
ZW02n0000_p0084a25_##得到古籍小組組長李一氓同志的支持並最後通過。
ZW02n0000_p0084a26_##<p,0,2>4.編製目錄。此目錄即《中華大藏經》正編的目錄。此目錄依
ZW02n0000_p0084a27_##《趙城金藏》千字文編次的順序排列，由童瑋先生排定，後經審閱打
ZW02n0000_p0085a01_##印80份，送中華書局、古籍小組及有關人士，供討論用。
ZW02n0000_p0085a02_##<p,0,2>5.樣書的編輯。此樣書的編輯體例是經任繼愈、童瑋、我共同
ZW02n0000_p0085a03_##研究，最後由我起草成文，打印，並交中華書局、古籍小組同意後執
ZW02n0000_p0085a04_##行，包括用什麼底本、如何補缺、如何校對、校勘記的內容、順次的安
ZW02n0000_p0085a05_##排、書樣、封面、扉頁等。於1985年正式出版。
ZW02n0000_p0085a06_##<p,0,2>三、《中華大藏經》的總體方案，可包括如下三點：
ZW02n0000_p0085a07_##<p,0,2>1.正編收錄歷代大藏經有千字文編號的部分，以《趙城藏》的目
ZW02n0000_p0085a08_##錄體系為基礎。《趙城藏》的缺帙部分以《高麗藏》的相應部分補足，
ZW02n0000_p0085a09_##其它缺帙以其他大藏的經籍按內容性質補入；續編收錄歷代大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0085a10_##中無千字文編號的部分，分翻譯典籍和中國撰述兩部分，重新編目。
ZW02n0000_p0085a11_##兩編總計收錄佛教典籍約4200餘種23000餘卷，從而形成集歷代大
ZW02n0000_p0085a12_##藏大成的新版藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0085a13_##<p,0,2>2.校本選用能反映上自隋唐下迄明清時代藏經基本面目且保
ZW02n0000_p0085a14_##存較多的八種版本，這就是《房山石經》、宋《資福藏》、《磧砂藏》、元
ZW02n0000_p0085a15_##《普寧藏》、明《南藏》、《徑山藏》、清《龍藏》及《高麗藏》。校勘採用逐
ZW02n0000_p0085a16_##字對校的辦法，勘出其異同，不作判斷，校勘記附於每卷經文之
ZW02n0000_p0085a17_##後。
ZW02n0000_p0085a18_##<p,0,2>3.正編全書以影印的辦法刊出；續編視情況而定。中國歷代大
ZW02n0000_p0085a19_##藏經版仍以影印為主，日本版諸藏經籍則標點排印。影印部分，務
ZW02n0000_p0085a20_##必達到清晰，故嚴重漫漶者或替換或修版。
ZW02n0000_p0085a21_##<p,0,2>四、《中華大藏經》編輯隊伍的組織情況。
ZW02n0000_p0085a22_##<p,0,2>因為《中華藏》的編輯工作是一項複雜的工程，包括總體方案的
ZW02n0000_p0085a23_##設計、底本的翻制和整理、校勘、校勘記的整理，最後的定稿等多種
ZW02n0000_p0085a24_##程序，故在領導小組之下設有底本組、校對組、校勘記編寫組、定稿
ZW02n0000_p0085a25_##組、協調組及終審等多種組織形式。每一組有專人負責，形成一個
ZW02n0000_p0085a26_##流水線工作系統。也因此編輯隊伍逐年擴大，從最初的五人，十幾
ZW02n0000_p0085a27_##人到最多時達到九十餘人的工作班子。
ZW02n0000_p0085a28_##<p,0,2>五、幾點經驗和教訓：
ZW02n0000_p0086a01_##<p,0,2>1.可靠的經費來源。《中華藏》因得到古籍小組在經費上的全
ZW02n0000_p0086a02_##力支援纔可能順利完成正編，13年間共得到古籍小組的正式撥款近
ZW02n0000_p0086a03_##160萬。
ZW02n0000_p0086a04_##<p,0,2>2.有一個穩定的、全力投入的編輯隊伍。
ZW02n0000_p0086a05_##<p,0,2>3.完備的可靠的資料來源。我們依靠北圖、宗教所圖書館及中
ZW02n0000_p0086a06_##國佛協圖晝館、中國佛教圖書文物館、北京市佛教協會圖書館的無
ZW02n0000_p0086a07_##私全力的支援，保證了資料的來源。
ZW02n0000_p0086a08_##<p,0,2>4.有一個周密的、操作性很強的編輯程序，使工作有條不紊的
ZW02n0000_p0086a09_##進行。
ZW02n0000_p0086a10_##<p,0,2>上述四條就[确>確]立了在事業上的人、財、物幾方面的保證，否則其
ZW02n0000_p0086a11_##事業就很難有成。
ZW02n0000_p0086a12_##<p,0,2>六、幾點建議：
ZW02n0000_p0086a13_##<p,0,2>我個人完全贊同中國佛協和佛教文化研究所的計劃，重編一部
ZW02n0000_p0086a14_##能夠替代日本《大正藏》的電腦化的大藏經。但此舉並非易事，故建
ZW02n0000_p0086a15_##議：
ZW02n0000_p0086a16_##<p,0,2>1.以僧界為主，充分發揮僧界的優勢。這本是歷代修藏的通
ZW02n0000_p0086a17_##例，祇有調動僧界護法的精誠，纔能有一個穩定的編輯隊伍和所需
ZW02n0000_p0086a18_##的物質保證，確保事業有成。
ZW02n0000_p0086a19_##<p,0,2>2.新版藏經要考慮中國佛教修藏的歷史傳統，不能出格太遠。
ZW02n0000_p0086a20_##故應以入藏典籍為主，新編入者亦應以僧人的著作為主，兼顧個別
ZW02n0000_p0086a21_##與僧界有大因緣的居士學者的著作。這應是一條原則，否則就要改
ZW02n0000_p0086a22_##名，就不是佛教大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0086a23_##<p,0,2>3.新版大藏要替代《大正藏》就一定要標點、校勘，並在出版成
ZW02n0000_p0086a24_##本上下功夫，使讀者能夠買得起。《大正藏》所以流行原因很多，但
ZW02n0000_p0086a25_##主要有三條：（1）它是近代以來中國歷代藏經均成為文物的情況下，
ZW02n0000_p0086a26_##用現代印刷手段新編的第一部藏經，佔了搶先一步和物以稀為貴的
ZW02n0000_p0086a27_##優勢；（2）作了簡單的標點，但問題很多；（3）價格適中，特別是後來臺
ZW02n0000_p0086a28_##灣大量的影印起了推波助瀾的作用。

ZW02n0000_p0087a04_##
ZW02n0000_p0087a05_##<p,0,2>佛教在臺灣擁有眾多信徒，佛教書刊的編輯出版活動也非常
ZW02n0000_p0087a06_##活躍，卷帙浩繁的各種大藏經不斷推出，成為這方面的一個顯著特
ZW02n0000_p0087a07_##點。
ZW02n0000_p0087a08_##<p,0,2>臺灣出版大藏經，是以1955年臺北中華佛教文化館影印《大
ZW02n0000_p0087a09_##正藏》開始的。1962年，臺北藝文印書館影印日本《卍續藏》；1968
ZW02n0000_p0087a10_##年，臺灣「中國佛教會」又與香港有關人士合作再次影印。70年代
ZW02n0000_p0087a11_##以後，臺北新文豐出版公司在影印各種版本大藏經上傾注了巨大
ZW02n0000_p0087a12_##努力，不但再度影印了《大正藏》、《卍續藏》，還用韓國東國大學影
ZW02n0000_p0087a13_##印本為底本重新影印了《再雕高麗藏》，以及日本《卍正藏》。祖國
ZW02n0000_p0087a14_##大陸的文物出版社重刷《龍藏》之後，新文豐出版公司很快據以影
ZW02n0000_p0087a15_##印為精裝本，名《乾隆版大藏經》。在此期間，《頻伽藏》、《普慧藏》
ZW02n0000_p0087a16_##（部分）及《藏要》也都改頭換面被影印出版。由日文本譯成中文的
ZW02n0000_p0087a17_##《南傳大藏經》，由敦煌寫經輯成的《敦煌大藏經》，由臺灣佛教學者
ZW02n0000_p0087a18_##藍吉富主編的《大藏經補編》，由南天書局編輯影印的《西藏大藏

ZW02n0000_p0087a20_##社開始發行「電腦排版」、「重新斷句、新式標點」的《文殊大藏經》，

ZW02n0000_p0087a25_##派的文獻集成。
ZW02n0000_p0087a26_##<p,0,2>但是，40年來臺灣社會有關各方費力最大、耗時最久的漢文
ZW02n0000_p0087a27_##大藏經編印項目，還要算1956年隆重開場、1982年勉強了事的所
ZW02n0000_p0088a01_##謂《中華大藏經》。
ZW02n0000_p0088a02_##<p,0,2>臺版《中華藏》的發起人是密宗施主屈映光，而實際上最早的
ZW02n0000_p0088a03_##倡印者應推蔡運辰。蔡運辰，1900年生於遼東，是名僧虛雲的俗
ZW02n0000_p0088a04_##家弟子，法名寬運，字念生。1951年3月，他在臺灣《覺生》雜誌上
ZW02n0000_p0088a05_##呼籲編印新藏，無人響應；1954年2月他又在《人生》雜誌首次提
ZW02n0000_p0088a06_##出《中華大藏經》這一名稱，唯含義與後來的不盡相同。到這年10
ZW02n0000_p0088a07_##月，屈映光有感於《清藏》刻成後200餘年無大舉修藏事，遂聯絡部
ZW02n0000_p0088a08_##分國民黨元老，動議編纂新藏，當時簽名贊同者有台灣僧俗要人
ZW02n0000_p0088a09_##210名。1956年11月11日，「修訂中華大藏經會」在臺北善導寺
ZW02n0000_p0088a10_##正式成立，簽過名的贊同者都是會員，屈映光任首席常務理事，蔡
ZW02n0000_p0088a11_##運辰為總編審。「修藏會」還在泰國、日本設立了分會或代理人。
ZW02n0000_p0088a12_##<p,0,2>臺版《中華藏》最初設想分為4大部分：1.選藏；2.續藏；3.
ZW02n0000_p0088a13_##譯藏；4.總目錄，共收書5,005部。「選藏」，又稱正藏，是全書的
ZW02n0000_p0088a14_##主要部分，擬分4輯依次出版。第1輯：影印1931～1935年上海
ZW02n0000_p0088a15_##出版的《影印宋磧砂藏》和1935年三時學會從《趙城藏》中編選的
ZW02n0000_p0088a16_##《宋藏遺珍》，有書1，581部；第2輯：影印明清遞刊版《嘉興藏》（已
ZW02n0000_p0088a17_##見第1輯的書不重收），有書658部；第3輯：影印日本《卍正藏》、
ZW02n0000_p0088a18_##《卍續藏》（已見1、2輯的書不重收），有書1,337部。3輯累計收
ZW02n0000_p0088a19_##書3,576部。第4輯收另外13種藏經中不見於前3輯的書，共
ZW02n0000_p0088a20_##400部。合4輯之數，選藏擬收書達3,976部，號稱「各藏經典，不
ZW02n0000_p0088a21_##重一部，不減一部，合成一帙」（蔡運辰：《中華大藏經序》）。對於各
ZW02n0000_p0088a22_##種藏經中同一部書因版本不同而出現的較大文字差異以及某些版
ZW02n0000_p0088a23_##本中增入的序跋等內容，選藏擬在第4輯後面設「綜合補錄」一項；
ZW02n0000_p0088a24_##蔡運辰專門編製了詳細目錄，指明應從何版中補錄哪段文字，這等
ZW02n0000_p0088a25_##於為讀者作了大量的校勘提示，其作用不可低估。選藏以外，計劃
ZW02n0000_p0088a26_##是：「續藏」，結集歷代未入藏之經典，收書970部；「譯藏」，專收由
ZW02n0000_p0088a27_##漢文譯成西文之經典，中外文對照刊印，收書20部；「總目錄」，編
ZW02n0000_p0088a28_##列各藏目錄及與目錄有關之書籍，收書39部。這後3大部分共有
ZW02n0000_p0089a01_##書1,029部。
ZW02n0000_p0089a02_##<p,0,2>如果臺版《中華藏》能按上面的設想全部完成，的確將是一部
ZW02n0000_p0089a03_##既有空前宏富的內容，又有文物觀賞價值的煌煌巨製。然而，光陰
ZW02n0000_p0089a04_##荏苒，「修藏會」困難重重，工作拖延再三，龐大的計劃最終夭折了。
ZW02n0000_p0089a05_##這對一開始企圖利用這個機會籠絡海內外中國佛教信徒，通過「修

ZW02n0000_p0089a07_##打擊。

ZW02n0000_p0089a09_##1968～1974年，第2輯出版，精裝80冊。同時出版了朱鏡宙編的
ZW02n0000_p0089a10_##第1輯索引和蔡運辰主編的《中華大藏經首編》。《首編》包括該藏
ZW02n0000_p0089a11_##序文9篇，「修藏會」成立時的章程、宣言等文件，編目通例，各輯編

ZW02n0000_p0089a16_##本」，即改原每頁三欄為兩欄，一下擴展成約100冊。第3輯預計
ZW02n0000_p0089a17_##也不低於此數。兩輯分別印到三、五十冊時，印刷經費竟被負責印

ZW02n0000_p0089a27_##應承擔繼續印刷，而此時掌管影印底本的一位林覺非居士又拒絕
ZW02n0000_p0089a28_##交出書來，祇好另外去找。到1982年，第1輯大字本和第3輯精
ZW02n0000_p0090a01_##裝各100冊費了九牛二虎之力總算印成，又配套重印了第2輯，

ZW02n0000_p0090a03_##了。
ZW02n0000_p0090a04_##<p,0,2>臺版《中華藏》共出版正藏3輯，計精裝280冊（第1輯以大字
ZW02n0000_p0090a05_##本冊數計），線裝本加倍；臺灣島內外購買全部三輯的訂戶不過
ZW02n0000_p0090a06_##150家左右。付之闕如的各個部分，還能不能問世？董正之祇好
ZW02n0000_p0090a07_##說：「祈禱佛陀」！
ZW02n0000_p0090a08_##<p,0,2>用實事求是的觀點看，臺版《中華藏》在編印過程中還是取得
ZW02n0000_p0090a09_##了一定成績的。最突出的是蔡運辰為確定全藏目錄所作的工作。
ZW02n0000_p0090a10_##蔡運辰任總編審後，首先「窮四年之力」，「搜羅古籍，獺祭群書」，
ZW02n0000_p0090a11_##「凡得刻藏目錄18種、輯藏目錄8種、專書5種，合為31種，綜合
ZW02n0000_p0090a12_##排比，鉤稽部數，校註異文」（聖嚴：《序〈二十五種藏經目錄對照考
ZW02n0000_p0090a13_##釋〉》），編成《三十一種藏經目錄對照表解》，統計各藏所有經書，共
ZW02n0000_p0090a14_##得4,166目，於1960年4月由「修藏會」出版；後又補入《金藏》目
ZW02n0000_p0090a15_##錄1種，成為32種；再從32種中刪去輯藏8種，另加《大正藏》目
ZW02n0000_p0090a16_##錄1種，並分別進行研究考釋，於1971年最終編成《二十五種藏經
ZW02n0000_p0090a17_##目錄對照考釋》一書，1983年12月由新文豐出版公司出版。這部
ZW02n0000_p0090a18_##16開760頁的著作，是佛教經籍目錄學的重要成果，連同先前出
ZW02n0000_p0090a19_##版的《中華大藏經首編》，給治佛學、修新藏者帶來了極大便利，是
ZW02n0000_p0090a20_##可以傳之久遠的。臺灣華宇出版社1986年出版藍吉富主編的《大
ZW02n0000_p0090a21_##藏經補編》第35冊中全文收錄了《中華大藏經首編》，藍吉富在說
ZW02n0000_p0090a22_##明中指出：「即使祇將此一書目瀏覽一過，也足以使人對中文佛典
ZW02n0000_p0090a23_##之美之富，有一初步之理解。」蔡運辰在參與修藏的20年裡，還在
ZW02n0000_p0090a24_##臺灣雜誌上發表了一系列文章，詳細探討有關這部藏經的很多問
ZW02n0000_p0090a25_##題，這些文章具有明確的學術價值，被收集在《如是庵學佛剩語》上
ZW02n0000_p0090a26_##冊，新文豐出版公司1983年出版。「選藏」第1輯中，有兩部經是
ZW02n0000_p0090a27_##上海版《影印磧砂藏》中失收的，這就是胡適在普林斯頓大學葛思
ZW02n0000_p0090a28_##德東方文庫發現的《磧砂藏》「寧四」、「更一」兩冊，分別為唐不空所
ZW02n0000_p0091a01_##譯《略述金剛頂瑜伽分別聖位修證法門》一卷和《瑜伽集要救阿難
ZW02n0000_p0091a02_##陀羅尼焰口儀軌經》一卷；第2輯中，有3部書實屬《嘉興藏》，而為
ZW02n0000_p0091a03_##《嘉興藏》目錄所不載，是在此次修藏時整理發現的，書名分別為：
ZW02n0000_p0091a04_##《雲棲法彙》、《布水臺集》、《鶴山禪師執帚集》。這些不易得見的版
ZW02n0000_p0091a05_##本被臺版《中華藏》影印公諸於世，值得慶幸。此外，臺版《中華藏》
ZW02n0000_p0091a06_##雖然在1982年就完結了，其「餘蔭」卻至今還嘉惠著臺灣的某些出
ZW02n0000_p0091a07_##版商。新文豐出版公司1986、1987兩年間，分別把原來該藏的1、
ZW02n0000_p0091a08_##2輯以《影印磧砂藏》（內含《宋藏遺珍》）和《影印嘉興藏》的名字重
ZW02n0000_p0091a09_##新印行，精裝各40冊；那位當初匿書不交的林覺非居士，1985年
ZW02n0000_p0091a10_##拿出了手裡的10種佛教寺誌膠卷，由杜洁祥印入丹青出版公司的
ZW02n0000_p0091a11_##《中國佛寺史誌彙刊》（第3輯），這10種寺誌都是被蔡運辰列入臺
ZW02n0000_p0091a12_##版《中華藏》「續藏」目錄的。直到新文豐出版公司陸續出版的《佛
ZW02n0000_p0091a13_##學名著百種》（70冊），從中還可以分辨出胎死腹內的「續藏」的面
ZW02n0000_p0091a14_##貌。當然，所有這種種新書，對學術界、宗教界的讀者都有著獨特
ZW02n0000_p0091a15_##的魅力，不僅僅是「嘉惠」出版商而已。
ZW02n0000_p0091a16_##<p,0,2>臺灣編印《中華大藏經》的始末表明，在不少古本藏經已星散
ZW02n0000_p0091a17_##各處的當代，要搞出既全又精的大藏經，離不開海內外的廣泛聯[係>繫]
ZW02n0000_p0091a18_##和密切協同。該藏的第2輯有相當一部分影印底本攝自日本駒澤
ZW02n0000_p0091a19_##大學，而其第4輯之所以無法開印，很大程度上是因為台灣當地缺
ZW02n0000_p0091a20_##少的各藏太多，甚至連明永樂南北藏這樣在祖國大陸往往可見的
ZW02n0000_p0091a21_##版本，臺灣竟一部沒有。正所謂「巧婦難為無米之炊」。修訂新藏
ZW02n0000_p0091a22_##是個浩大的工程，非一年半載之功。必須有周密的計劃，嚴謹的部
ZW02n0000_p0091a23_##署，科學的組織，依靠強勁的領導，得力的骨幹，精幹的隊伍，還要
ZW02n0000_p0091a24_##獲得可靠的長期財力及印刷能力的支持。最後，還需要堅韌不拔
ZW02n0000_p0091a25_##的意志和同心同德的團結。臺版《中華藏》的經驗教訓，對於我們
ZW02n0000_p0091a26_##今後從事類似的編藏工作，也是有可以借鑒之處的。

ZW02n0000_p0092a06_##<p,0,2>籌備會議的先生指定我談一談海外大藏經編輯以及光電版大
ZW02n0000_p0092a07_##藏經的情況。我是一個關門作學問的人，對外界的情況瞭解得很
ZW02n0000_p0092a08_##不夠。下面談的有些情況是我自己掌握、瞭解的；關於臺灣與美國
ZW02n0000_p0092a09_##的不少情況則是盧潯先生最近從INTERNET網上收集到以後提
ZW02n0000_p0092a10_##供給我的；還有一些情況則是張新鷹先生提供的。在此特向盧潯
ZW02n0000_p0092a11_##先生與張新鷹先生表示感謝。由於條件有限，今天介紹的情況肯
ZW02n0000_p0092a12_##定不夠全面與正確。錯漏之處，請大家指正。
ZW02n0000_p0092a13_##<p,0,2>大藏經是中國人創造的一個詞彙，指佛教典籍的總彙，在古代
ZW02n0000_p0092a14_##中國，它主要指漢文佛教典籍。在現代中國，「大藏經」除了指漢傳
ZW02n0000_p0092a15_##佛教傳承的漢文大藏經外，包括南傳佛教傳承的巴利語大藏經、藏
ZW02n0000_p0092a16_##傳佛教傳承的藏文大藏經，還包括諸如梵文佛教典籍、各種西域文
ZW02n0000_p0092a17_##字佛教典籍以及我國的西夏文大藏經、蒙文大藏經、滿文大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0092a18_##範圍更廣一點，甚至可以包括近代以來出現的日文佛教典籍（如
ZW02n0000_p0092a19_##《國譯一切經》）以及西文翻譯的佛教典籍。
ZW02n0000_p0092a20_##<p,0,2>從重要性而言，上述諸種佛教典籍，有的因亡佚過多而零亂不
ZW02n0000_p0092a21_##成系統；有的則是從現存的其他藏經中流出。所以，最為重要的是
ZW02n0000_p0092a22_##現存三大系佛教所傳承的巴利語大藏經、漢文大藏經與藏文大藏
ZW02n0000_p0092a23_##經。不過，由於「大藏經」這個詞是中國人創造的，所以雖然中國人
ZW02n0000_p0092a24_##用「大藏經」指代世界上各種文字的佛教經典，並創造出諸如巴利
ZW02n0000_p0092a25_##語大藏經、藏文大藏經這樣的名詞。但這些名詞基本上祇在漢傳
ZW02n0000_p0092a26_##佛教區域內流通。在南傳佛教區域，人們稱自己的佛教典籍為「三
ZW02n0000_p0092a27_##藏」；在藏傳佛教區域，人們稱自己的佛教典籍為「甘珠爾」、「丹珠
ZW02n0000_p0093a01_##爾」。正像我們用「大藏經」來稱呼南傳佛教的巴利語三藏一樣，南
ZW02n0000_p0093a02_##傳佛教區域的人們則用「三藏」來稱呼漢文大藏經。以至西方世界
ZW02n0000_p0093a03_##受此影響，至今仍用「三藏」來稱呼漢文大藏經。所以，本文所謂的
ZW02n0000_p0093a04_##「大藏經」，僅指漢文大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0093a05_##<p,0,2>從歷史上看，在佛教文化圈中，大藏經主要流傳於漢傳佛教影
ZW02n0000_p0093a06_##響所及的東亞各國。近代以來，由於佛教文化圈之外的世界其他
ZW02n0000_p0093a07_##國家，主要是西方各國，對佛教的認識與研究主要沿著巴利語佛
ZW02n0000_p0093a08_##教、梵文佛教、藏文佛教這樣一條路線前進，所以在這些國家，大藏
ZW02n0000_p0093a09_##經，亦即漢文佛教典籍的影響不是很大。但近年來這種情況開始
ZW02n0000_p0093a10_##有所改觀，不少西方學者開始日益重視對大藏經的研究。不過，重
ZW02n0000_p0093a11_##視大藏經的勢頭出現的時間還不太久，在西方的宗教研究界，對大
ZW02n0000_p0093a12_##藏經的總體研究與整理實際上還處在醞釀階段，或者說起步階段。
ZW02n0000_p0093a13_##所以，所謂海外對大藏經的編印現在主要局限在漢傳佛教流傳區
ZW02n0000_p0093a14_##域，亦即臺灣、香港、日本、韓國。九十年代以來這項工作在美國發
ZW02n0000_p0093a15_##展較快，但主要集中在華人圈子裡。西方人也有參加並起到重要
ZW02n0000_p0093a16_##作用的，但人數較少。
ZW02n0000_p0093a17_##<p,0,2>本世紀以來，世界上出現兩次編輯大藏經的熱潮。第一次是
ZW02n0000_p0093a18_##本世紀初到二、三十年代。當時我國編印的有《頻伽藏》、《普慧藏》
ZW02n0000_p0093a19_##（未完成）、《影印磧砂藏》、《宋藏遺珍》、《藏要》等。日本則有《卍字
ZW02n0000_p0093a20_##藏》、《卍字續藏》、《大正藏》。第二次熱潮於五十年代中、後期開始
ZW02n0000_p0093a21_##發韌。當時臺灣屈映光、蔡念生等發起成立「修訂中華大藏經會」，
ZW02n0000_p0093a22_##編印《中華大藏經》。大陸的中國佛教協會也有編輯新的大藏經的
ZW02n0000_p0093a23_##設想，並編纂了供討論的草目，這就是二十年後呂澂先生發表的
ZW02n0000_p0093a24_##《新編漢文大藏經目錄》。日本則有修訂重印《大正藏》與重編《大
ZW02n0000_p0093a25_##正藏索引》之舉。這一熱潮到八十年代趨向高漲，大陸編印了新的
ZW02n0000_p0093a26_##《中華大藏經》，重印《藏要》，修補刷印了《龍藏》。臺灣則編印《佛
ZW02n0000_p0093a27_##光大藏經》、《文殊大藏經》，影印了《嘉興藏》、影印了大陸新印的
ZW02n0000_p0093a28_##《龍藏》與三十年代出版的《影印磧砂藏》、《宋藏遺珍》、《藏要》。還
ZW02n0000_p0094a01_##影印了《高麗藏》、《大正藏》、《卍字藏》、《卍字續藏》等。此外還有
ZW02n0000_p0094a02_##大陸、臺灣合作編輯出版的《敦煌大藏經》。日本則影印了《高麗
ZW02n0000_p0094a03_##藏》、修訂重印了《卍字續藏》。韓國影印了《高麗藏》。八十年代中
ZW02n0000_p0094a04_##期開始，隨著電腦技術的飛速發展，大藏經也開始踏入光電時代。
ZW02n0000_p0094a05_##經過幾年的醞釀，到九十年代初，大藏經光電化的進程顯著加快。
ZW02n0000_p0094a06_##可以說，第二次編印大藏經的熱潮現在正處在方興未艾之際。
ZW02n0000_p0094a07_##<p,0,2>上述兩次熱潮，第一次的情況大家都很熟悉，所以下面主要對
ZW02n0000_p0094a08_##海外第二次熱潮的情況加以介紹。在第二次熱潮中，重點放在大
ZW02n0000_p0094a09_##藏經光電化方面。
ZW02n0000_p0094a10_##
ZW02n0000_p0094a11Q3#二
ZW02n0000_p0094a12_##<p,0,2>先談談第二次熱潮中海外出現的書冊版的大藏經。這些大藏
ZW02n0000_p0094a13_##經又可以分為三類：一、影印的；二、修訂重印的；三、新編的。下面
ZW02n0000_p0094a14_##分別介紹。
ZW02n0000_p0094a15_##<p,0,2>一、影印大藏經，指完全照底本影印，不作任何變動，或僅作個
ZW02n0000_p0094a16_##別修訂。
ZW02n0000_p0094a17_##<p,0,2>如前所述，海外影印的大藏經很多，下面擇要介紹：
ZW02n0000_p0094a18_##<p,0,2>1.《高麗藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0094a19_##<p,0,2>此處的《高麗藏》指朝鮮高麗朝高宗時刊刻的大藏經，又稱《再
ZW02n0000_p0094a20_##刻高麗藏》，以區別於顯宗朝刊刻的《初刻高麗藏》。該藏校勘精
ZW02n0000_p0094a21_##良，是諸種大藏經中質量較高的一種，版片現存韓國海印寺。影印
ZW02n0000_p0094a22_##本共出現四種：
ZW02n0000_p0094a23_##<p,0,2>第一種是東洋出版社出版的錦裝豪華本，全45冊。但祇有正
ZW02n0000_p0094a24_##藏，既沒有補遺部分，也沒有總目與解題索引。這實際是供佛教團
ZW02n0000_p0094a25_##體供養用的。
ZW02n0000_p0094a26_##<p,0,2>第二種是韓國東國大學校出版的，全48冊。這種版本藏經的
ZW02n0000_p0094a27_##前25冊中，諸經的次序有錯亂，沒有完全按照總目排列；諸冊的目
ZW02n0000_p0094a28_##錄上也沒有標明經典的編號。後來發現這一問題，從第26冊起予
ZW02n0000_p0095a01_##以改正。全藏包括正藏、補遺、總目、解題索引等。由於前25冊次
ZW02n0000_p0095a02_##序錯亂，所以不能根據總目及解題索引進行檢索。
ZW02n0000_p0095a03_##<p,0,2>第三種也是韓國東國大學校出版的，實際是第二種的修訂版。
ZW02n0000_p0095a04_##亦即將已經出版的前25冊按照總目的次序重新編排，並在每冊的
ZW02n0000_p0095a05_##目錄上加上該經的編號。內容則與第二種一樣，也是48冊，包括
ZW02n0000_p0095a06_##正藏、補遺、總目、索引等。不過這種重新修訂的版本祇刊印發行
ZW02n0000_p0095a07_##了300部。
ZW02n0000_p0095a08_##<p,0,2>第四種是臺灣新文豐出版公司重印東國大學版。遺憾的是他
ZW02n0000_p0095a09_##們重印的不是第三種修訂版，而是第二種有錯誤的版本。全48
ZW02n0000_p0095a10_##冊。
ZW02n0000_p0095a11_##<p,0,2>2.《磧砂藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0095a12_##<p,0,2>臺灣新文豐出版。是根據三十年代上海影印的《磧砂藏》重印
ZW02n0000_p0095a13_##的。原藏有殘缺，係據《普寧藏》等藏經補齊。此次影印則將胡適
ZW02n0000_p0095a14_##在美國普林斯頓大學圖書館發現的若干卷抽換補入。原書線裝，
ZW02n0000_p0095a15_##新文豐本改為精裝，全40冊。
ZW02n0000_p0095a16_##<p,0,2>3.《嘉興藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0095a17_##<p,0,2>臺灣新文豐出版。是依據明版《嘉興藏》影印的，但刪除了其
ZW02n0000_p0095a18_##中《影印本磧砂藏》已經收入的諸種典籍。全40冊。實際是下述
ZW02n0000_p0095a19_##臺灣《中華大藏經》第二輯的再印本。
ZW02n0000_p0095a20_##<p,0,2>4.《乾隆大藏經》：
ZW02n0000_p0095a21_##<p,0,2>臺灣新文豐出版。是根據文物出版社影印出版的《龍藏》縮版
ZW02n0000_p0095a22_##重印的。
ZW02n0000_p0095a23_##<p,0,2>5.《大正藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0095a24_##<p,0,2>早在1955年，臺北中華佛教文化館便開始影印《大正藏》。其
ZW02n0000_p0095a25_##後又有其他單位對該藏進行影印。七十年代後，臺灣新文豐大量
ZW02n0000_p0095a26_##影印該藏。新文豐影印本基本依據日本《大正藏》不變，但在第85
ZW02n0000_p0095a27_##卷中加入胡適關於敦煌禪籍研究的一些資料。
ZW02n0000_p0095a28_##<p,0,2>另外，臺灣還大量影印了《宋藏遺珍》、《藏要》、《頻伽藏》、《普
ZW02n0000_p0096a01_##慧藏》、《卍字藏》、《卍字續藏》，都是完全依據原書影印，內容、編次
ZW02n0000_p0096a02_##均沒有變化，不再一一介紹。
ZW02n0000_p0096a03_##<p,0,2>上述影印藏經，除了豪華本《高麗藏》的目的是提供寺院供養
ZW02n0000_p0096a04_##外，其他諸種藏經的目的都是向研究者提供資料。所以都採用縮
ZW02n0000_p0096a05_##印的辦法，裝幀也比較一般，採取薄利多銷政策，價格比較便宜，海
ZW02n0000_p0096a06_##外一般的研究者都可以承受。
ZW02n0000_p0096a07_##<p,0,2>影印藏經，臺灣出版界的勁頭最大。現有的大藏經，祇要是他
ZW02n0000_p0096a08_##們能夠得到的，已經都影印了。我認為，這裡首先是學術驅動，即
ZW02n0000_p0096a09_##佛教研究越來越為人們所重視，客觀上對佛教典籍的需求日益在
ZW02n0000_p0096a10_##擴張。其次是經濟驅動，即出版商看到上述趨勢，認識到這是一個
ZW02n0000_p0096a11_##賺錢的好機會，所以不惜大投入，以爭取大回報。
ZW02n0000_p0096a12_##<p,0,2>對於學術界來說，不少典籍過去很難見到，現在影印本十分普
ZW02n0000_p0096a13_##遍，則資料的收集工作相對就容易得多了，從而推動了學術研究的
ZW02n0000_p0096a14_##發展，這當然是一件好事。影印本保留了原本的狀態，有很高的學
ZW02n0000_p0096a15_##術價值。遺憾的是有些影印本的編纂者不注意版本的精選，有的
ZW02n0000_p0096a16_##還對底本進行割版修補，實際上損害了這些典籍在版本方面的學
ZW02n0000_p0096a17_##術價值。
ZW02n0000_p0096a18_##<p,0,2>二、修訂重印的：
ZW02n0000_p0096a19_##<p,0,2>屬於修訂重印的有日本的《大正藏》與《卍字續藏》。
ZW02n0000_p0096a20_##<p,0,2>1.《大正藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0096a21_##<p,0,2>大家對《大正藏》都比較熟悉。六十年代初，日本在重印《大正
ZW02n0000_p0096a22_##藏》時，對其中的一些錯誤作了修訂，但修訂的比例不大。關於《大
ZW02n0000_p0096a23_##正藏》，我最近寫了一篇評論文章，即將發表在《佛教圖書評論》的
ZW02n0000_p0096a24_##創刊號上。所以這兒就不佔用大家的時間了。
ZW02n0000_p0096a25_##<p,0,2>2.《卍字續藏》：
ZW02n0000_p0096a26_##<p,0,2>《卍字續藏》，又名《大日本續藏經》，由前田慧雲、中野達慧等
ZW02n0000_p0096a27_##主持，編纂於1905年至1912年。收經1756部，絕大部分為歷代
ZW02n0000_p0096a28_##大藏經未收的佛教典籍。10門63類，線裝751冊。本藏編印時
ZW02n0000_p0097a01_##正值日俄戰爭，故每冊還載有戰爭陣亡人員名單。優點是收羅宏
ZW02n0000_p0097a02_##富，缺點是編次較亂，選本不精，又缺乏必要的校勘。
ZW02n0000_p0097a03_##<p,0,2>1973年起，由河村孝照主持，對該《續藏經》進行重修。重修
ZW02n0000_p0097a04_##本定名為《新纂大日本續藏經》，對原藏的編次作了調整，內容作了
ZW02n0000_p0097a05_##增刪，每部經附加編號，刪除了陣亡者名單。改為精裝，分為90冊
ZW02n0000_p0097a06_##（含總目、索引各一冊）。從1975年到1989年出版齊全。共收經
ZW02n0000_p0097a07_##1671部，計1.02億字。
ZW02n0000_p0097a08_##<p,0,2>《大正藏》所收以已入藏典籍為主，《卍字續藏》所收則絕大多
ZW02n0000_p0097a09_##數為未入藏典籍。兩藏合計約2.5億字。如果把近代以來的佛教
ZW02n0000_p0097a10_##撰著捨略不計，則現存的辛亥革命以前的有關佛教的典籍的總量
ZW02n0000_p0097a11_##估計在3.5億字上下。也就是說，日本的這兩部藏經已經涵蓋了
ZW02n0000_p0097a12_##現存的古代佛教典籍的百分之七十。而下餘的百分之三十（1億
ZW02n0000_p0097a13_##字左右），恰恰是最零亂，最分散，從來沒有人收集整理過，因而最
ZW02n0000_p0097a14_##不易措手的部分。日本向來以《大正藏》為驕傲，認為是世界上最
ZW02n0000_p0097a15_##精良的藏經版本，事實上到目前為止也的確還沒有一部藏經的學
ZW02n0000_p0097a16_##術水平能夠超過《大正藏》。通過重修《卍字續藏》，日本在藏外典
ZW02n0000_p0097a17_##籍的整理方面也進一步取得了優勢。估計今後日本會在大藏經日
ZW02n0000_p0097a18_##譯、各種索引的編纂以及《大正藏》與《續藏經》的光電版方面下功
ZW02n0000_p0097a19_##夫，以繼續保持其在佛教典籍的整理方面的優勢地位。
ZW02n0000_p0097a20_##<p,0,2>三、新編印的
ZW02n0000_p0097a21_##<p,0,2>海外出版的新編印的大藏經有臺灣《中華大藏經》、《文殊大藏
ZW02n0000_p0097a22_##經》、《佛光大藏經》、《敦煌大藏經》以及《大藏經補編》、《南傳大藏
ZW02n0000_p0097a23_##經》（從日文轉譯）等。這裡介紹臺灣《中華大藏經》、《文殊大藏經》
ZW02n0000_p0097a24_##與《佛光大藏經》。
ZW02n0000_p0097a25_##<p,0,2>1.臺灣《中華大藏經》的具體編輯工作由蔡念生負責。從蔡念
ZW02n0000_p0097a26_##生公佈的目錄草案看，他原計劃把全部佛典重新組織，分為14類
ZW02n0000_p0097a27_##86部，共收入佛典3874部。但後來放棄了這個計劃，改為影印出
ZW02n0000_p0097a28_##版。臺灣《中華大藏經》現已出版三輯。第一輯為影印《影印磧砂
ZW02n0000_p0098a01_##藏》與《宋藏遺珍》；第二輯為影印《嘉興藏》中第一輯未收的諸種典
ZW02n0000_p0098a02_##籍；第三輯為影印《卍字藏》、《卍字續藏》中未為前兩輯所收的典
ZW02n0000_p0098a03_##籍。三輯均有精裝、線裝兩種版式。精裝一冊相當於線裝兩冊。
ZW02n0000_p0098a04_##其中第一輯又有大字本、小字本兩種版式。大字本一頁二欄，欄
ZW02n0000_p0098a05_##18行；小字本一頁三欄，欄30行。此外，計劃中的還有：
ZW02n0000_p0098a06_##<p,0,2>第四輯，影印《縮刷藏》、《大正藏》及其他諸種藏經中未為第
ZW02n0000_p0098a07_##一、二、三輯所收的典籍。
ZW02n0000_p0098a08_##<p,0,2>續藏，未為上述四輯所收的其他佛教典籍。
ZW02n0000_p0098a09_##<p,0,2>上述五部分，前四輯相當於歷代正藏與續藏，最後的「續藏」實
ZW02n0000_p0098a10_##際為新編入藏。由於種種原因，臺灣《中華大藏經》出版三輯後無
ZW02n0000_p0098a11_##以為繼，故此停頓。
ZW02n0000_p0098a12_##<p,0,2>2.《文殊大藏經》，1987年開始由臺灣文殊佛教文化中心編
ZW02n0000_p0098a13_##印，文殊出版社出版。當時計劃所收經典全部校勘、註釋、新式標
ZW02n0000_p0098a14_##點。每部典籍均附有導論，導論中彙集世界重要的佛教經典研究
ZW02n0000_p0098a15_##成果，「使讀者迅速進入經典」。還計劃附有重要論文選編與研究
ZW02n0000_p0098a16_##論著目錄索引、詞語索引等。總計174冊。但實際上據說祇出版
ZW02n0000_p0098a17_##了數冊，第二年便停止編輯。
ZW02n0000_p0098a18_##<p,0,2>3.《佛光大藏經》，由臺灣佛光山編藏處編纂。計劃將全部佛
ZW02n0000_p0098a19_##典分為阿含、禪藏、般若、本緣、法華、華嚴、淨土、律、唯識、秘密、論
ZW02n0000_p0098a20_##藏、史傳、文藝等十六部，校勘，標點，排印。已經完成阿含部（17
ZW02n0000_p0098a21_##卷，1987年出版）、禪藏部（51卷，1993年出版）。近期將出齊般若
ZW02n0000_p0098a22_##部。從已經出版的兩部看，《佛光大藏經》的結構體例在《大正藏》
ZW02n0000_p0098a23_##的基礎上有所改革。每部設若干類。如禪藏中設史傳類、語錄類、
ZW02n0000_p0098a24_##禪論禪詩類、公案辭書類等四類。收經範圍不局限在傳統的正藏、
ZW02n0000_p0098a25_##續藏的框架內，而是廣收博採。如收入敦煌文獻、傳世未入藏著作
ZW02n0000_p0098a26_##（如《禪林象器箋》）、乃至《虛雲和尚年譜》、《星雲禪話》等。校勘、
ZW02n0000_p0098a27_##標點比較精良，每部附有參考文獻與詞語索引。照排精裝，使用方
ZW02n0000_p0098a28_##便。
ZW02n0000_p0099a01_##
ZW02n0000_p0099a02Q3#三
ZW02n0000_p0099a03_##<p,0,2>下面談談佛典光電化問題。
ZW02n0000_p0099a04_##<p,0,2>用電腦輸入佛典，印刷書冊本大藏經，進而編纂光電版大藏
ZW02n0000_p0099a05_##經，這在海外是八十年代中期開始的，九十年代初逐漸形成熱潮。
ZW02n0000_p0099a06_##其實，類似的工作我們在1986年也開始了。1986年上半年，我曾
ZW02n0000_p0099a07_##經代表《中華大藏經》委託當時社科院文學所欒貴明同志進行過這
ZW02n0000_p0099a08_##一研究。欒貴明同志按照我們提出的設計要求進行了佛經錄入以
ZW02n0000_p0099a09_##及詞語索引等試驗。試驗本身比較順利，但後來由於其他原因，這
ZW02n0000_p0099a10_##一合作沒有能堅持下去。1989年以後，《中華大藏經》在工作中，
ZW02n0000_p0099a11_##利用電腦錄入300餘萬字，其中照排編入《中華大藏經》者200餘
ZW02n0000_p0099a12_##萬字。由於力量有限，錄入照排工作僅局限在《中華大藏經》迫切
ZW02n0000_p0099a13_##需要的部分，沒有全面展開。當時的想法是根據條件，逐步輸入，
ZW02n0000_p0099a14_##並逐步向光電版大藏經發展。整個八十年代，海外這方面的工作
ZW02n0000_p0099a15_##進展得一般，但進入九十年代以後，發展得比較快，最近這二、三年
ZW02n0000_p0099a16_##尤其迅速，已經形成一股相當可觀的力量。目前大體上有這麼五
ZW02n0000_p0099a17_##個區域性中心：
ZW02n0000_p0099a18_##<p,0,2>一、日本
ZW02n0000_p0099a19_##<p,0,2>日本這方面的工作集中在京都與東京。
ZW02n0000_p0099a20_##<p,0,2>京都：
ZW02n0000_p0099a21_##<p,0,2>1.花園大學國際禪學研究所
ZW02n0000_p0099a22_##<p,0,2>這項工作主要由該所副所長烏．阿浦（URS APP）博士主持，
ZW02n0000_p0099a23_##從1990年開始的，目前主要從事禪籍的輸入與禪數據庫的建立。
ZW02n0000_p0099a24_##1993年以前，他們主要從事基礎研究與軟件開發。1993年起開始
ZW02n0000_p0099a25_##文獻錄入。漢字平臺先採用日本JIS，後改用臺灣BIG5。有些文獻
ZW02n0000_p0099a26_##兩者可以兼用。已經錄入禪文獻數十種，印行了十餘種並附有一
ZW02n0000_p0099a27_##字索引，錄入文獻時均按照國際規範在原文上附加各種檢索記號，
ZW02n0000_p0099a28_##便於從各方面檢索。已發行光盤一張。並在INTERNET網上公
ZW02n0000_p0100a01_##佈近30種關於禪學的文獻資料。由於缺乏佛典的標點、校勘人
ZW02n0000_p0100a02_##員，所以工作的進度比較慢。另外，由於現有的漢字平臺中漢字數
ZW02n0000_p0100a03_##量不夠，不能滿足佛典錄入的需要，所以必須自己造字。為了使這
ZW02n0000_p0100a04_##些自己造的字能夠流通起來，與其他人相互交流，他們把所造的字
ZW02n0000_p0100a05_##附載在光盤中，與光盤文獻一起流通。
ZW02n0000_p0100a06_##<p,0,2>他們主張：輸入前，對每一部佛典都應收齊各種版本；輸入時，
ZW02n0000_p0100a07_##每一個字在不同版本的不同形態，均按原樣輸入。即儘量保持各
ZW02n0000_p0100a08_##版本的原有形態。輸入後形成的文獻雖然是一篇，但通過上面的
ZW02n0000_p0100a09_##各種標記，實際可以反映出該文獻各種版本的原貌。這樣，對每一
ZW02n0000_p0100a10_##篇電子文獻，不但能夠調出它的標準的校勘標點本，而且能夠調出
ZW02n0000_p0100a11_##它的各種版本形態。最近他們正在按照上述設想輸入敦煌文獻。
ZW02n0000_p0100a12_##敦煌寫經中的異體字、變體字非常多，還有各種各樣的符號等，如
ZW02n0000_p0100a13_##果原樣輸入敦煌文獻的各種技術問題都能夠順利解決，則佛典的
ZW02n0000_p0100a14_##輸入也就不會有什麼解決不了的難題了。
ZW02n0000_p0100a15_##<p,0,2>2.京都大學人文科學研究所
ZW02n0000_p0100a16_##<p,0,2>主持人為高田時雄。該項工作從1992年開始，主要是錄入
ZW02n0000_p0100a17_##《大正藏》的「史傳部」，即《大正藏》第49卷到第52卷，並編纂有關
ZW02n0000_p0100a18_##索引。現已經完成了《高僧傳》、《法顯傳》、《大唐西域記》、《釋迦方
ZW02n0000_p0100a19_##誌》、《遊方記抄》、《洛陽伽藍記》等。所用的漢字平臺是日本的
ZW02n0000_p0100a20_##JIS。高田時雄是個語言學家，漢文水平很好，承擔的研究也很多，
ZW02n0000_p0100a21_##是日本青年敦煌學者組織的核心人物之一。
ZW02n0000_p0100a22_##<p,0,2>3.京都禪文化研究所
ZW02n0000_p0100a23_##<p,0,2>該所也在花園大學校園內，但不屬於花園大學，與國際禪學研
ZW02n0000_p0100a24_##究所也互不統屬。正在錄入的文獻以禪文獻與中國古籍為主。他
ZW02n0000_p0100a25_##們不太贊同編纂一字索引的做法，認為實用價值不大。因此自己
ZW02n0000_p0100a26_##另行編輯詞語索引。他們編纂的詞語索引，都另行配套印行供檢
ZW02n0000_p0100a27_##索的原典，自成體系。已經錄入與計劃錄入的有《景德傳燈錄》、
ZW02n0000_p0100a28_##《祖堂集》、《太平御覽》、《太平廣記》等數十種。錄入工作主要在中
ZW02n0000_p0101a01_##國（上海）完成，拿回日本校對定稿，然後在天津印刷。出版物免費
ZW02n0000_p0101a02_##贈送給有關學者與研究機構。該研究所與中國的語言文字方面的
ZW02n0000_p0101a03_##研究者關係比較密切，共同成立了「俗語言研究學會」並共同創辦
ZW02n0000_p0101a04_##了一個名叫《俗語言研究》的雜誌。
ZW02n0000_p0101a05_##<p,0,2>所用的漢文平臺為日本的JIS。
ZW02n0000_p0101a06_##<p,0,2>4.法寶義林研究所
ZW02n0000_p0101a07_##<p,0,2>該研究所設在京都相國寺，是日本、英國、法國等國的一個合
ZW02n0000_p0101a08_##作項目，主要是把《法寶義林》輸入電腦，並做成能夠完成英、法、中
ZW02n0000_p0101a09_##文多種檢索功能的數據庫。
ZW02n0000_p0101a10_##<p,0,2>5.淨土真宗教學研究所
ZW02n0000_p0101a11_##<p,0,2>主要從事《大正藏》中若干典籍之錄入，如《十住毗婆沙論》、
ZW02n0000_p0101a12_##《觀無量壽經義疏》、《安樂集》等。漢文平臺為日本JIS。
ZW02n0000_p0101a13_##<p,0,2>6.淨土真宗聖典
ZW02n0000_p0101a14_##<p,0,2>擬把47種淨土真宗的主要典籍製作成光盤，由本願寺出版社
ZW02n0000_p0101a15_##負責。
ZW02n0000_p0101a16_##<p,0,2>7.天台電子佛典計劃
ZW02n0000_p0101a17_##<p,0,2>由大津市的天台宗睿山學院天台宗典編纂所負責，把天台宗
ZW02n0000_p0101a18_##的主要典籍及註疏輸入電腦，做成光盤。全部約360萬字，基本是
ZW02n0000_p0101a19_##根據《大正藏》錄入。
ZW02n0000_p0101a20_##<p,0,2>東京：
ZW02n0000_p0101a21_##<p,0,2>1.《大正藏》錄入計劃
ZW02n0000_p0101a22_##<p,0,2>由日本印度學佛教學研究會與大藏出版社負責。該項目於
ZW02n0000_p0101a23_##1994年已經開始，計劃把《大正藏》做成光盤。該項目接受日本文
ZW02n0000_p0101a24_##部省的資助，預訂由大藏出版社出版。
ZW02n0000_p0101a25_##<p,0,2>2.日蓮數據庫
ZW02n0000_p0101a26_##<p,0,2>由立正大學三友健容負責。主要是把日蓮的著作輸入電腦，
ZW02n0000_p0101a27_##並輸入關於日蓮的詞典等。原計劃祇做光電文獻，沒有檢索系統。
ZW02n0000_p0101a28_##用的是日本NEC的專用設備，與IBM機不兼容，甚至與日本一般
ZW02n0000_p0102a01_##的文字處理機也不兼容。所以基本祇能供立正大學內部使用。
ZW02n0000_p0102a02_##<p,0,2>3.曹洞宗宗學數據庫
ZW02n0000_p0102a03_##<p,0,2>由駒澤大學的曹洞宗宗學研究所負責。輸入有關曹洞宗的各
ZW02n0000_p0102a04_##種資料，漢字平臺是日本的JIS。
ZW02n0000_p0102a05_##<p,0,2>除了上述集體項目外，很多大學的教師由於個人研究需要，也
ZW02n0000_p0102a06_##在從事這一漢文佛典的電腦錄入工作。如京都大學的長尾雅人、
ZW02n0000_p0102a07_##廣島大學的桂紹隆、花園大學的沖本克己、龍谷大學的能仁、大阪
ZW02n0000_p0102a08_##聖心女子學院的瀨間等等。他們基本上都是依據《大正藏》，利用
ZW02n0000_p0102a09_##JIS。各人的條件不同，做法也是五花八門。另外花園大學佛教學
ZW02n0000_p0102a10_##科也錄入了一些典籍。
ZW02n0000_p0102a11_##<p,0,2>綜上所述，除了1994年上馬的《大正藏》項目外，其他的項目
ZW02n0000_p0102a12_##都有一定的局限性，而且宗派性、個人性的色彩很濃。所配備的計
ZW02n0000_p0102a13_##算機環境與軟件也各不相同。互相之間缺乏聯係與協調，基本上
ZW02n0000_p0102a14_##各自為戰。
ZW02n0000_p0102a15_##<p,0,2>二、韓國
ZW02n0000_p0102a16_##<p,0,2>韓國以曾經編輯《高麗藏》與至今收藏著《高麗藏》的版片而自
ZW02n0000_p0102a17_##豪。他們的光電版大藏經計劃也圍繞著《高麗藏》而進行。
ZW02n0000_p0102a18_##<p,0,2>這一工作由收藏《高麗藏》版片的海印寺主持，韓國著名的大
ZW02n0000_p0102a19_##企業三星公司為後援。錄入工作從1992年開始，最初兩卷在上海
ZW02n0000_p0102a20_##用BIG5碼輸入後拿回韓國校對。後來改為在韓國本土錄入。錄
ZW02n0000_p0102a21_##入的最大困難是錄入員漢字水平太差，對付不了那些複雜的漢字。
ZW02n0000_p0102a22_##韓國雖然仍然留用一部分漢字，但與佛經漢字比較起來實在微不
ZW02n0000_p0102a23_##足道。加上《高麗藏》中有許多古今字、異體字、正俗字、變體字，對
ZW02n0000_p0102a24_##於一般的人來講實在很困難。據說他們最後是利用中國的「鄭
ZW02n0000_p0102a25_##碼」，並按照《高麗藏》的字體造了大批的漢字，幾乎是有一個變體
ZW02n0000_p0102a26_##就造一個字。錄入人員可以完全按照自己所看到的字體進行輸
ZW02n0000_p0102a27_##入。如果發現輸入的這個字還沒有造，就打一個星號，通知造字人
ZW02n0000_p0102a28_##員補造。按照原定計劃，1996年3月完成全部錄入校對工作。
ZW02n0000_p0103a01_##<p,0,2>除了《高麗藏》之外，還由 PAENG NYON 佛教文化基金負責
ZW02n0000_p0103a02_##將《韓國佛教全書》輸入電腦。據說第一部分元曉的著作約70萬
ZW02n0000_p0103a03_##字，已經在中國錄入完成。
ZW02n0000_p0103a04_##<p,0,2>上面日本與韓國的大藏經光電化工作，雖然在目的、規模等方
ZW02n0000_p0103a05_##面互不相同，但是有一點是共同的，即基本上由佛教團體把它當作
ZW02n0000_p0103a06_##一件佛教的事業來做。雙方都有大批學者參加，但由於日本與韓
ZW02n0000_p0103a07_##國的歷史原因，這些學者大多有佛教背景。
ZW02n0000_p0103a08_##<p,0,2>三、香港
ZW02n0000_p0103a09_##<p,0,2>香港的情況與前述日本、韓國的情況不同。香港的佛教團體
ZW02n0000_p0103a10_##對於編纂大藏經與大藏經光電化態度不一。有的比較冷漠，有的
ZW02n0000_p0103a11_##則有興趣，但總的來說是覺得這件事規模太大，望而生畏。但香港
ZW02n0000_p0103a12_##的學者對此卻有熱情。中文大學的中國文化研究所有一個古文獻
ZW02n0000_p0103a13_##資料庫計劃，非常龐大，計劃把中國古籍都輸入電腦。第一階段是
ZW02n0000_p0103a14_##輸入秦漢古籍約800萬字，1993年已經完成，並出版了102種文
ZW02n0000_p0103a15_##獻的索引。第二階段是輸入六朝以來的道教文獻與佛教文獻（依
ZW02n0000_p0103a16_##據《大正藏》、《卍字續藏》等錄入）。目前進展情況不詳。漢字庫是
ZW02n0000_p0103a17_##BIG5。不過已經完成並上市的電子文獻資料庫價格很貴，一般人
ZW02n0000_p0103a18_##難以問津。
ZW02n0000_p0103a19_##<p,0,2>四、臺灣
ZW02n0000_p0103a20_##<p,0,2>1.中央研究院計算中心
ZW02n0000_p0103a21_##<p,0,2>該中心已經出版了「二十四史」的光盤，已經完成與正在輸入
ZW02n0000_p0103a22_##的還有《十三經註疏》、諸子、敦煌文獻、金石資料、佛典等。佛典是
ZW02n0000_p0103a23_##依據《大正藏》輸入的。
ZW02n0000_p0103a24_##<p,0,2>2.佛光山
ZW02n0000_p0103a25_##<p,0,2>佛光山的光電版佛典可以分為三個方面：
ZW02n0000_p0103a26_##<p,0,2>第一，圍繞《佛光大藏經》進行。《佛光大藏經》是用電腦照排
ZW02n0000_p0103a27_##的，轉換為電子版上網，或轉換為光盤版，都非常容易。估計佛光
ZW02n0000_p0103a28_##山將會推出光電版的《佛光大藏經》。
ZW02n0000_p0104a01_##<p,0,2>第二，輸入《大正藏》的若干典籍，這主要是在佛光山北海道場
ZW02n0000_p0104a02_##進行。
ZW02n0000_p0104a03_##<p,0,2>第三，把《佛光大辭典》及佛經目錄輸入電腦。
ZW02n0000_p0104a04_##<p,0,2>後兩件工作正在進行。
ZW02n0000_p0104a05_##<p,0,2>由於臺灣佛教山頭林立，很難統一觀點，統一行動，所以佛光
ZW02n0000_p0104a06_##山編纂《佛光大藏經》及光電版佛典也是自成一家。不過，佛光山
ZW02n0000_p0104a07_##參加了「電子佛典推進協議會」與「電子佛典協會」這兩個國際性的
ZW02n0000_p0104a08_##電子佛典協調組織，與世界上其他正在從事同類工作的單位有著
ZW02n0000_p0104a09_##較為密切的聯係，臺灣中央研究院的一些學者也與他們有業務的
ZW02n0000_p0104a10_##聯[係>繫]與交往。佛光山已經答應把《佛光大辭典》輸入電腦後可以供
ZW02n0000_p0104a11_##「電子佛典協會」發佈的光盤公開使用。今後，佛光山的光電版大
ZW02n0000_p0104a12_##藏經計劃與其他單位主持的光電版大藏經計劃，想必還需要協調。
ZW02n0000_p0104a13_##<p,0,2>3.臺灣大學文學院佛學研究中心
ZW02n0000_p0104a14_##<p,0,2>這是1995年2月新成立的機構，全部都是學者，其中有若干
ZW02n0000_p0104a15_##僧人學者，人員包括臺灣島內外的不少知名人物。成立緣起中說：
ZW02n0000_p0104a16_##佛學研究在歐美與日本成績斐然，近年來大陸有急起直追之勢，而
ZW02n0000_p0104a17_##臺灣雖有七、八十人，卻缺乏合作，所以成立這樣一個機構。在活
ZW02n0000_p0104a18_##動內容中有「廣泛收集國內外佛學文獻資料，建立系統化之佛學文
ZW02n0000_p0104a19_##獻資料庫」一項。並有一個「佛學資料庫國際網絡」的計劃。
ZW02n0000_p0104a20_##<p,0,2>這個機構雖然成立不久，但發展很快，已經入網並發佈資料。
ZW02n0000_p0104a21_##<p,0,2>從網上可以知道，臺灣還有不少佛教機構在從事這方面的工
ZW02n0000_p0104a22_##作並發送信息。在此不一一列舉。它們大多提供光電版佛典，並
ZW02n0000_p0104a23_##要求閱讀者也能向它提供佛典文本或信息。普及是提高的基礎。
ZW02n0000_p0104a24_##如果能夠把這些分散的力量團結在一個總目標之下，那將是非常
ZW02n0000_p0104a25_##可觀的。
ZW02n0000_p0104a26_##<p,0,2>五、美國
ZW02n0000_p0104a27_##<p,0,2>1.佛教電腦資訊庫功德會
ZW02n0000_p0104a28_##<p,0,2>1994年9月在美國成立。設在美國紐約世界宗教研究院，負
ZW02n0000_p0105a01_##責人有沈家楨、沈乃宣等，到1995年4月中旬，已經設立7個分庫
ZW02n0000_p0105a02_##（美國6個，臺灣1個），有會員167人。採用人工以及掃瞄的辦法
ZW02n0000_p0105a03_##輸入佛典及工具書。像丁福保《佛學大辭典》、《大般若》等數十種
ZW02n0000_p0105a04_##佛典、明末四大高僧全集等。他們已經公佈了一張《金剛經》的光
ZW02n0000_p0105a05_##盤，免費提供給會員。另外，正在編纂新的光盤，內容是常用經咒，
ZW02n0000_p0105a06_##及《佛光大辭典》、《佛學大辭典》、《翻譯名義集》等三本工具書。據
ZW02n0000_p0105a07_##說這片光盤的設計思想是充分利用多媒體的功能，用聲音、圖片、
ZW02n0000_p0105a08_##表格、動畫、影片等手段配合經文。遇到不明白的名詞，祇要按一
ZW02n0000_p0105a09_##下鼠標，就可以顯示工具書中解釋。在經解部分，也可以參閱有關
ZW02n0000_p0105a10_##註釋；也可以聽梵唄等。公佈日期一再推遲，主要困難在於（1）造
ZW02n0000_p0105a11_##字；（2）佛光山答應的《佛光大辭典》的提供使用問題。
ZW02n0000_p0105a12_##<p,0,2>這個組織主要由華人佛教徒組成，與臺灣佛教界、學術界關係
ZW02n0000_p0105a13_##密切，很多工作都合作進行。現在很活躍，工作效率看起來也比較
ZW02n0000_p0105a14_##高。
ZW02n0000_p0105a15_##<p,0,2>2.加利福尼亞大學佛教研究所
ZW02n0000_p0105a16_##<p,0,2>該研究所蘭卡斯特教授早在八十年代中期已經在呼籲加強對
ZW02n0000_p0105a17_##漢文大藏經的研究。他也在從事這方面的工作。
ZW02n0000_p0105a18_##<p,0,2>此外，在美國、歐洲、澳大利亞都還有人從事這方面的工作，這
ZW02n0000_p0105a19_##裡就不一一介紹了。
ZW02n0000_p0105a20_##<p,0,2>從上面並不完全的介紹可以知道，電子佛典的工作在世界上
ZW02n0000_p0105a21_##已經蓬蓬勃勃地開展起來了。據我瞭解與考慮，現在的問題主要
ZW02n0000_p0105a22_##是如下幾個方面：
ZW02n0000_p0105a23_##<p,0,2>1.編輯方面的問題
ZW02n0000_p0105a24_##<p,0,2>首先，大家都有心做電子佛典，但到底做一個什麼樣的東西，
ZW02n0000_p0105a25_##大家的意見並不統一。如，是做一個標準定本，還是僅提供原始資
ZW02n0000_p0105a26_##料？到底是搞光電版大藏經，還是某些經典的集合？如果搞光電
ZW02n0000_p0105a27_##版大藏經，那麼是輸入現成的某一部大藏，還是新編一部大藏？要
ZW02n0000_p0105a28_##充分發揮光盤的多媒體功能，這一點大家是一致的。但光電版佛
ZW02n0000_p0106a01_##典的多媒體怎麼搞，還在摸索當中。
ZW02n0000_p0106a02_##<p,0,2>其次，用什麼底本，看來還是一個難題。由於《大正藏》目前的
ZW02n0000_p0106a03_##學術地位，也由於缺乏校勘、標點人材，無法儘快做出一個精良的
ZW02n0000_p0106a04_##定本，所以目前很多單位不得不依據《大正藏》輸入。但《大正藏》
ZW02n0000_p0106a05_##的版權屬於日本有關單位，因此問題比較複雜。
ZW02n0000_p0106a06_##<p,0,2>第三、缺乏校勘、標點底本的人員。這是一個大問題。
ZW02n0000_p0106a07_##<p,0,2>第四、要使光電版大藏經發揮作用，必須使它能夠實現多重檢
ZW02n0000_p0106a08_##索，那麼，檢索系統的設計與文獻上檢索點的確定與標記成為必須
ZW02n0000_p0106a09_##首先解決的前提。而這是一些學術性、技術性很強，工作量又非常
ZW02n0000_p0106a10_##大的工作，非一般人能夠勝任。
ZW02n0000_p0106a11_##<p,0,2>第五、電腦輸入快，校對定稿慢，已經成為各單位的一個瓶頸。
ZW02n0000_p0106a12_##<p,0,2>2.電腦問題
ZW02n0000_p0106a13_##<p,0,2>首先是漢字平臺問題。現在雖有多種漢字庫，但內碼不統一，
ZW02n0000_p0106a14_##而且無論那種字庫，所收漢字的數量都不能滿足需要。大家祇好
ZW02n0000_p0106a15_##自己造字，而自己造的字則五花八門，互不統一，使得錄出的文獻
ZW02n0000_p0106a16_##互不流通。將來即使流通大字庫，統一造字的問題同樣會存在。
ZW02n0000_p0106a17_##<p,0,2>其次是光盤檢索軟件問題，要做成一個使用方便的光盤，這個
ZW02n0000_p0106a18_##問題一定要解決好。
ZW02n0000_p0106a19_##<p,0,2>3.人力、財力問題
ZW02n0000_p0106a20_##<p,0,2>缺少佛典方面的專家、高水平的校勘標點人員、電腦技術人
ZW02n0000_p0106a21_##員。缺少足夠的經濟力量。
ZW02n0000_p0106a22_##<p,0,2>4.協調問題
ZW02n0000_p0106a23_##<p,0,2>光電版大藏經工程浩大，大家的人力財力都有限，本來應該協
ZW02n0000_p0106a24_##調一致，以充分利用現有的人力、物力。但由於種種原因，缺少必
ZW02n0000_p0106a25_##要的協調，以至出現大量的重複勞動。有的經典被反覆輸入多次，
ZW02n0000_p0106a26_##甚至十多次，乃至幾十次。
ZW02n0000_p0106a27_##<p,0,2>上述問題已經引起海外從事這一工作的人士的注意，於是出
ZW02n0000_p0106a28_##現了兩個專門進行協調的組織：
ZW02n0000_p0107a01_##<p,0,2>一、電子佛典推進協議會
ZW02n0000_p0107a02_##<p,0,2>該會是1993年4月26日在美國成立的。早期參加者有美國
ZW02n0000_p0107a03_##加利福尼亞大學、日本立正大學、美國加利福尼亞大學佛教研究
ZW02n0000_p0107a04_##所、臺灣佛光佛教文化研究所、日本花園大學國際禪學研究所、韓
ZW02n0000_p0107a05_##國海印寺、韓國漢城國立大學、馬來西亞佛道修行者共同體等。推
ZW02n0000_p0107a06_##舉加利福尼亞大學的蘭卡斯特教授為理事長，花園大學烏．阿浦為
ZW02n0000_p0107a07_##秘書長。這是一個鬆散的團體，本身既沒有常設機構，也不規劃項
ZW02n0000_p0107a08_##目。祇是起溝通信息的作用，力圖以此來協調參加單位的工作，從
ZW02n0000_p0107a09_##而達到促進佛典的輸入與利用的目的。以花園大學的《電子達摩》
ZW02n0000_p0107a10_##（從第三期起）作為機關刊物。
ZW02n0000_p0107a11_##<p,0,2>該組織一成立，就訪問了臺灣、香港、曼谷，也來到北京、上海。
ZW02n0000_p0107a12_##了解情況，尋求合作。徵集到一些新的加盟者。1994年1月與5
ZW02n0000_p0107a13_##月，分別在香港、臺灣召開過兩次研討會。9月底到10月初，在韓
ZW02n0000_p0107a14_##國海印寺召開年會。會上交流了關於日本花園大學禪學研究所的
ZW02n0000_p0107a15_##禪數據庫、美國康乃爾大學的雲南寫本佛典計劃、泰國摩訶道兒大
ZW02n0000_p0107a16_##學的泰文巴利大藏經計劃、斯里蘭卡的僧伽羅大藏經計劃、佛光山
ZW02n0000_p0107a17_##的佛教詞典與佛光大藏經計劃、韓國的《高麗藏》計劃的情況，並就
ZW02n0000_p0107a18_##軟件等技術交流經驗與作了演示。會議改選了領導機構，選舉蘭
ZW02n0000_p0107a19_##卡斯特為會長，約翰．列曼為美洲聯絡人，烏．阿浦為亞洲聯絡人，
ZW02n0000_p0107a20_##戈．維迪安為歐洲聯絡人。1996年4月上旬在臺灣佛光山再次集
ZW02n0000_p0107a21_##會，表示要對萬馬奔騰似的電子佛典發展現狀進行整合。
ZW02n0000_p0107a22_##<p,0,2>這個組織聯絡廣泛，除了非洲，五大洲都聯[係>繫]了。不僅漢文大
ZW02n0000_p0107a23_##藏經，也包括其他語種的大藏經。但搞漢文大藏經的人在其中占
ZW02n0000_p0107a24_##主要地位。有一些西方人參加，並起到重要作用。思路比較嚴謹，
ZW02n0000_p0107a25_##重視計算機基礎。
ZW02n0000_p0107a26_##<p,0,2>二、中華電子佛典協會（中華電子佛典工作委員會）
ZW02n0000_p0107a27_##<p,0,2>1994年開始籌備，由大願顧問公司的楊國屏先生為召集人，
ZW02n0000_p0107a28_##佛光山、中央研究院、美國莊嚴寺等為主要參加單位，各參加單位
ZW02n0000_p0108a01_##分頭工作，進行佛典的電子化並入網傳輸。參加者主要是臺灣與
ZW02n0000_p0108a02_##美國兩地的華人。
ZW02n0000_p0108a03_##<p,0,2>由於條件有限，上面介紹的情況未免掛一漏萬。歸納上述情
ZW02n0000_p0108a04_##況，就光電版大藏經而言，可總結如下二點：
ZW02n0000_p0108a05_##<p,0,2>一、海外的佛典電子化工作基本上是各自為政，百花齊放。基
ZW02n0000_p0108a06_##本是各單位根據各自的需要與能力就部分佛典而進行的。真正有
ZW02n0000_p0108a07_##意做成光電版大藏經的，目前祇有韓國的《高麗藏》光電版（即將完
ZW02n0000_p0108a08_##成）。日本的《大正藏》光電版（正在進行），臺灣的《佛光藏》光電版
ZW02n0000_p0108a09_##想必最終也會推出。
ZW02n0000_p0108a10_##<p,0,2>二、由於協調性機構已經出現，由於光電版文獻本身的易拷貝
ZW02n0000_p0108a11_##性，並便於再次被整理、被編輯，所以，集合分散的力量，彙集各單
ZW02n0000_p0108a12_##位輸入的經本，重新編輯加工而成為新的光電版大藏經相對來說
ZW02n0000_p0108a13_##是一件比較容易的事。因此，目前雖然沒有這方面的消息，但我們
ZW02n0000_p0108a14_##必須充分看到由某個協調機構出面，協調編纂新的光電版大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0108a15_##的可能性。

ZW02n0000_p0109a02Q2#大藏經編纂及電腦化研討會發言摘要
ZW02n0000_p0109a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0109a04_##<p,0,2>編者按：為全面反映此次研討會的情況，除了將會議論文結集
ZW02n0000_p0109a05_##發表外，由有關同志根據錄音將其它諸位先生在會議上的發言整
ZW02n0000_p0109a06_##理後，摘要發表如下。發言摘要依據會議發言的先後次序排列。
ZW02n0000_p0109a07_##
ZW02n0000_p0109a08_##<p,0,2>王學信（《華聲月報》主任記者）：我國自古以來便是文明禮儀
ZW02n0000_p0109a09_##之邦，歷代朝野緇素自來推重文化典籍的修撰、編纂、刻印、收藏。
ZW02n0000_p0109a10_##這一優良傳統，代有相繼，累世不衰，薪火相傳、文脈為繼。遂使我
ZW02n0000_p0109a11_##中華民族擁有舉世矚目的極其豐富、又多姿多彩的文化積澱，為建
ZW02n0000_p0109a12_##設我國的當代精神文明提供了蘊藏豐厚的資源。
ZW02n0000_p0109a13_##<p,0,2>在我國歷史上，每當太平盛世，便有朝廷主持的文治之舉，將
ZW02n0000_p0109a14_##當時的文化建設推往極致。可謂「為天地立心，為生民立道，為往
ZW02n0000_p0109a15_##聖繼絕學，為萬世開太平」，以彰千古同文之盛。改革開放以來，我
ZW02n0000_p0109a16_##國進入有史以來的最好歷史時期，政局穩定，社會祥和，上下一心，
ZW02n0000_p0109a17_##共創大業。經濟高速增長，國際威望日見提高，中華之騰飛崛起，
ZW02n0000_p0109a18_##當指日可待。譽之為太平盛世，殊不為過。建設無愧於偉大時代
ZW02n0000_p0109a19_##的文化偉業，自然也就提到了議事日程。
ZW02n0000_p0109a20_##<p,0,2>中華傳統文化的精要即是震鑠古今、精深博大的儒、釋、道三
ZW02n0000_p0109a21_##家之學。此三家之學，雖經歷史推移，時代變遷，不僅未能湮沒、消
ZW02n0000_p0109a22_##亡，反而日見光大。使更多的中外有識之士得以從中收取無盡的
ZW02n0000_p0109a23_##營養及啟迪，造福人類與社會。千百年來，以儒、釋、道三家之學為
ZW02n0000_p0109a24_##主要內涵的中華傳統文化，養育了一代又一代英才輩出的炎黃子
ZW02n0000_p0109a25_##孫，造就了眾多的忠臣名將、先哲聖賢，以及詩人學者、藝苑名家，
ZW02n0000_p0109a26_##古代科技界的燦爛群星。中華傳統文化以其無與倫比的感召力、
ZW02n0000_p0110a01_##向心力和凝聚力，無論過去、現在、未來，都是維繫全體炎黃子孫的
ZW02n0000_p0110a02_##血脈和紐帶。中華傳統文化在與西方文化日益頻繁的撞擊、交流、
ZW02n0000_p0110a03_##融合中，必將優勢互補，孕育、產生出新的更完美的人類文化，開啟
ZW02n0000_p0110a04_##未來世紀人類文明的新曙光。
ZW02n0000_p0110a05_##<p,0,2>佛教文化在中華傳統文化寶庫中有著重要的地位，佛教典籍
ZW02n0000_p0110a06_##除佛教自身外，還涉及哲學、倫理學、歷史學、語言學、邏輯學、文
ZW02n0000_p0110a07_##學、藝術、算學、醫學、天文學、社會學、民俗學等諸多領域，是極其
ZW02n0000_p0110a08_##珍貴的歷史文化遺產。大藏經作為漢文佛教典籍的總匯，歷代均
ZW02n0000_p0110a09_##曾印行。雖然大藏經的眾多版本均功不可沒，但是基於種種原因，
ZW02n0000_p0110a10_##各版大藏經皆非善本。諸多遺漏、舛誤及體例上的駁雜，難以盡如
ZW02n0000_p0110a11_##人意，每令人為之扼腕長歎。重修一部善本精品《中華大藏經》，並
ZW02n0000_p0110a12_##使之結合現代高科技，進入光電化，則勢在必行。
ZW02n0000_p0110a13_##<p,0,2>國務院宗教局此次牽頭召集中國佛教協會、中國社會科學院
ZW02n0000_p0110a14_##宗教研究所、中國綜合開發研究院的高僧大德、專家學者共襄盛
ZW02n0000_p0110a15_##舉，以期在未來若干年內完成此項文化史上空前的偉業，堪稱極具

ZW02n0000_p0110a25_##示堅決支持。上周，我接待了臺灣佛光山的一個代表團，他們也談
ZW02n0000_p0110a26_##到希望在編纂大藏經方面進行合作的事。可見海峽兩岸都十分關
ZW02n0000_p0110a27_##心這件事情。
ZW02n0000_p0110a28_##<p,0,2>我們現在做這件事，條件應該說已經比較好了。我今天講話
ZW02n0000_p0111a01_##也是給打打氣，我們一定要做好這件跨世紀的大事。現在大家開
ZW02n0000_p0111a02_##這個研討會，意見也可能會有分歧。但我相信分歧也祇是在怎麼
ZW02n0000_p0111a03_##做上，而不在做不做上。從佛教協會的角度講，我們義不容辭。南
ZW02n0000_p0111a04_##傳佛教、藏傳佛教的信徒也都會支持這件事，因為這是各民族佛教
ZW02n0000_p0111a05_##徒共同的事業。
ZW02n0000_p0111a06_##
ZW02n0000_p0111a07_##<p,0,2>杜繼文（中國社會科學院宗教所研究員、原所長）：編纂新的大
ZW02n0000_p0111a08_##藏經是國家的盛舉。我本人非常支持，而且希望很快就能夠實施。
ZW02n0000_p0111a09_##它的重要性與必要性，剛纔大家都講了，我在這兒不再重複。我想
ZW02n0000_p0111a10_##強調的一點是：一開始，我們究竟從哪裡著手？
ZW02n0000_p0111a11_##<p,0,2>我個人認為《大正藏》的好處是方便、實用。它的校勘也是現
ZW02n0000_p0111a12_##代校勘，我們要做到它那個程度，大概要費點功夫。有一次，臺灣
ZW02n0000_p0111a13_##一位學者在北京大學講話，給我的印象很深。他批評我們現在出
ZW02n0000_p0111a14_##版的一些佛教書籍的標點，說：「這種標點的書我就不用。不僅如
ZW02n0000_p0111a15_##此，如果有誰依據這種書來寫文章，那種文章我也不讀。」也就是
ZW02n0000_p0111a16_##說，我們現在有些書籍標點的錯誤太多，沒有權威性。臺灣用的是
ZW02n0000_p0111a17_##《大正藏》，但我認為《大正藏》同樣也不能作為最後的權威的版本。
ZW02n0000_p0111a18_##相反，我認為《中華藏》值得重視。我校勘過幾部經，就我校對過的
ZW02n0000_p0111a19_##幾部經來看，《中華藏》最可靠，最有權威性。至於具體哪幾部，細
ZW02n0000_p0111a20_##節如何，這裡就不詳細講了。總而言之，《中華藏》可以作為一種權
ZW02n0000_p0111a21_##威版本。而《大正藏》不能作為權威版本。因此，我主張新的編藏
ZW02n0000_p0111a22_##工作以現在的《中華藏》影印本為基礎來進行。
ZW02n0000_p0111a23_##<p,0,2>第二步就是繼續完成《中華藏》下編的問題。這項工作現在停
ZW02n0000_p0111a24_##頓了。停頓的原因很簡單，就是沒有錢。由於這項工作準備得比
ZW02n0000_p0111a25_##較充分，收集的材料比較多，份量比較大，日本等國都沒有這樣的
ZW02n0000_p0111a26_##藏經，我們把它編纂出來，可能要屬於世界第一了吧。如果能夠把
ZW02n0000_p0111a27_##《中華藏》的下編完成，我認為是功德無量，非常之好。希望國家能
ZW02n0000_p0111a28_##夠支持。如果宗教局從《中華藏》著手，把整個的上、下兩編全部做
ZW02n0000_p0112a01_##出來，就可以說把基礎打下來了。在這個基礎上，無論是標點也
ZW02n0000_p0112a02_##好，校勘也好，輸入電腦也好，都有了最基本的材料。否則，恐怕下
ZW02n0000_p0112a03_##邊的工作不太好做。
ZW02n0000_p0112a04_##<p,0,2>最近我看了幾本書，用的本子權威性還是差。我看到的國內
ZW02n0000_p0112a05_##外比較有權威的學者常用的中國人編纂的大藏經，一個是《頻伽
ZW02n0000_p0112a06_##藏》，一個是《磧砂藏》，它們比起《中華藏》，都差遠了。所以我建議
ZW02n0000_p0112a07_##從《中華藏》開始新的編藏工作。
ZW02n0000_p0112a08_##<p,0,2>會議讓我介紹六十年代初期，呂澂先生的《新編漢文大藏經目
ZW02n0000_p0112a09_##錄》的情況。這件事情的基本情況都反映在呂先生《談〈新編漢文
ZW02n0000_p0112a10_##大藏經目錄〉譯本部分的編次》中，對這個問題，當時有些爭論，其
ZW02n0000_p0112a11_##中周叔迦先生提的意見比較多、比較中肯。呂澂先生根據周叔迦
ZW02n0000_p0112a12_##先生的意見又作了補充。寫了《有關大乘經分類部分的補充說
ZW02n0000_p0112a13_##明》。這個材料可參考。這裡的中心問題是什麼呢？呂澂先生私
ZW02n0000_p0112a14_##下講過這麼一層意思，覺得中國人用《大正藏》，不太好使。因為漢
ZW02n0000_p0112a15_##文大藏經本來以中國為主，而現在這個文化中心不在中國，跑到日
ZW02n0000_p0112a16_##本了。這當然有些歷史原因，我們過去破壞得比較厲害。六十年
ZW02n0000_p0112a17_##代初，經濟恢復，文化也比較發展，所以當時考慮中國人應重新編
ZW02n0000_p0112a18_##輯大藏經，這也是提高民族自尊心。在編輯體例方面，當時也考慮
ZW02n0000_p0112a19_##到可以衝破日本的，傳統的。呂澂先生主張從研究的角度，從歷史
ZW02n0000_p0112a20_##的角度，從學科的角度重新分類。他對《大正藏》的編法也提出一
ZW02n0000_p0112a21_##些不同的看法。《大正藏》說是按歷史次序，實際上那種歷史次序
ZW02n0000_p0112a22_##很難成立。呂澂先生主張按照思想內容來分。我個人認為，根據
ZW02n0000_p0112a23_##思想內容分也很難。有些問題是很難分的。究竟怎麼分，我建議
ZW02n0000_p0112a24_##到了操作階段，開專門會議，進行專門的討論，今天在這裡很難討
ZW02n0000_p0112a25_##論，因為這個問題涉及的面太專，不適於大範圍討論。
ZW02n0000_p0112a26_##<p,0,2>另一個問題。中國的大藏經，當然以漢文為主。如果以漢文
ZW02n0000_p0112a27_##為主，那就應該把日本人的漢文著作，朝鮮人的漢文著作，越南人
ZW02n0000_p0112a28_##的漢文著作都吸收進來，比較全面的反映漢文大藏經的全部面貌。
ZW02n0000_p0113a01_##在這一點上，我們過去沒有十分注意越南。當然，究竟越南現在佛
ZW02n0000_p0113a02_##教典籍的現狀如何，我不太清楚。聽說是有不少史料，其中與禪宗
ZW02n0000_p0113a03_##有關的資料較多，是我們這裡所沒有的。過去我對日本的著作也
ZW02n0000_p0113a04_##不太重視。最近看了空海的著作，大吃一驚。他在宗教方面的貢
ZW02n0000_p0113a05_##獻這裡就不講了，他在文化上的貢獻也很大。比如對韓愈的研究，
ZW02n0000_p0113a06_##在中國歷史上也數得上，此外，對中國文字的研究，對語音學、對四
ZW02n0000_p0113a07_##聲的研究，都算得上好手。過去我沒有想到他會有這麼好的研究，
ZW02n0000_p0113a08_##寫了這麼厚一本書，國內已經有譯本。對這些非中國人寫的古代
ZW02n0000_p0113a09_##漢文佛教典籍，我們也要重視，吸收到新的大藏經中，吸收到《中華
ZW02n0000_p0113a10_##藏》的下編。這部分東西出來，同樣是我們的國寶。
ZW02n0000_p0113a11_##<p,0,2>大家都說《中華藏》不好讀，實用價值低。我也同意。但要講
ZW02n0000_p0113a12_##最後的權威性，大概還要算它。它用起來不方便，沒有標點，校勘
ZW02n0000_p0113a13_##在後面，還得一行一行地找，那麼大一本書，很難。但講權威性，還
ZW02n0000_p0113a14_##是它。當然也不是說編得就那麼理想，但這個路子應該堅持。出
ZW02n0000_p0113a15_##於這樣的思路，所以我建議首先來做《中華藏》下編的工作。
ZW02n0000_p0113a16_##<p,0,2>再回到呂澂先生當年的目錄上，當時大家的分歧主要在分類
ZW02n0000_p0113a17_##上。不少人批評呂先生的分類是一家之言，學派性太強。但他是
ZW02n0000_p0113a18_##從文化，從學術這個角度來談的。作為探討問題的一個藍本，也還
ZW02n0000_p0113a19_##可以繼續討論。
ZW02n0000_p0113a20_##
ZW02n0000_p0113a21_##<p,0,2>欒貴明（中國社會科學院文學所研究員）：電子大藏經的工作，
ZW02n0000_p0113a22_##我是1986年開始的。這個工作很重要，也很複雜。關於這個問
ZW02n0000_p0113a23_##題，剛纔大家談了很多。總結起來，人、財、資料、編纂程序等問題。
ZW02n0000_p0113a24_##我覺得更重要的還有信息。就是國際、國內目前此項工作的進展
ZW02n0000_p0113a25_##情況。如剛纔介紹的國外大藏經錄入的情況，就很重要。另外，大
ZW02n0000_p0113a26_##家也都知道，兩部大藏經。一個是我們這邊的，一個的臺灣編纂
ZW02n0000_p0113a27_##的。這兩部大藏經都有各自的教訓。教訓很重要，但主要還是成
ZW02n0000_p0113a28_##就。它們的成果，我們要用。比如《大正藏》標點的成果，我們要充
ZW02n0000_p0114a01_##分的利用。因為你要超過別人，必須站在別人的肩上。如果覺得
ZW02n0000_p0114a02_##丟人，不肯站在別人的肩膀上，那就無法超過人。這與體育比賽不
ZW02n0000_p0114a03_##同，百米賽跑，不可能別人跑前60米，我來跑後40米。文化是積
ZW02n0000_p0114a04_##累的，如果我們不能學習別人，就無法進步。問題在於怎樣學習別
ZW02n0000_p0114a05_##人？我們不能抄襲，而是創造性地接受它們的成果。這是今後在
ZW02n0000_p0114a06_##大藏經的編纂方面應該特別注意的問題。在這個過程中，當然要
ZW02n0000_p0114a07_##嚴格遵守版權法。
ZW02n0000_p0114a08_##<p,0,2>剛纔大家談了不少，我也覺得總體來說，的確有它的難度。但
ZW02n0000_p0114a09_##現在與86、87、88年不一樣了。那時我剛輸入幾卷《中華藏》的經
ZW02n0000_p0114a10_##典做實驗，方廣錩天天在我那兒守著。做了以後，覺得有些問題。
ZW02n0000_p0114a11_##現在也還有一些問題，但比那時要少多了，科學進步非常快，很有
ZW02n0000_p0114a12_##希望。總結起來，我覺得人有。財也是小問題。資料、信息、怎麼
ZW02n0000_p0114a13_##編等等，都可以解決。最最關鍵的是由宗教局來組織這件事。這
ZW02n0000_p0114a14_##是第一位的。過去這件事沒有搞成，就差一步之遙了，關鍵就在這
ZW02n0000_p0114a15_##裡。所以聽了這會，我覺得更有信心了。至於計算機的具體技術
ZW02n0000_p0114a16_##問題、學術與技術如何結合問題都是相當次要的。
ZW02n0000_p0114a17_##<p,0,2>大藏經如何編？今天大家講得比較徹底。雖然有些還沒有展
ZW02n0000_p0114a18_##開，但對我是重要啟發，也更有信心了。現在各方面的條件已經比
ZW02n0000_p0114a19_##較具備了。我認為此事不用太長的時間。現在我們的手段也已經
ZW02n0000_p0114a20_##充分現代化了，有些事情可以事半功倍，甚至一事幾功。我估算了
ZW02n0000_p0114a21_##一下，覺得不用超過五年。二年之內應該出初步成果。當然，如果
ZW02n0000_p0114a22_##講到書冊本，這是電子化以外的另一個問題。現在看來，作為珍藏
ZW02n0000_p0114a23_##本、傳世本，可以用電子版，但在過渡時期，書冊本仍然需要。而新
ZW02n0000_p0114a24_##版大藏經，作為中華人民共和國的代表性的文化工程，不能影印。
ZW02n0000_p0114a25_##一定要新排，一定要有標點。這一點無需討論。如果我們拿個「百
ZW02n0000_p0114a26_##納本」或別的什麼本來代表我們的水平，這總說不過去。由於有印
ZW02n0000_p0114a27_##刷、排版、還有詳細的校對、標點等過程，所以書冊本的時間相應要
ZW02n0000_p0114a28_##長一點。能夠在十年以內拿出來，這差不多。但電子大藏經，就我
ZW02n0000_p0115a01_##們已經具備的條件看，它一旦把產品，即大藏經製成後，以後幾年
ZW02n0000_p0115a02_##的工作，可以自動生成，可以由比較低層次的人來進行。這樣可以
ZW02n0000_p0115a03_##避免大藏經虎頭蛇尾。因為我們現在有了計算機。我們不唯計算
ZW02n0000_p0115a04_##機論，但計算機的確有它的優越性。電子版做成後，可以一本一本
ZW02n0000_p0115a05_##出書冊版。現在計算機與印刷的連接也比較簡單。我認為無論如
ZW02n0000_p0115a06_##何編輯工作不能超過五年。如果條件具備，完全可以做到。儘管
ZW02n0000_p0115a07_##大藏經有各種各樣的複雜問題，但計算機可以滿足各方面的要求。
ZW02n0000_p0115a08_##祇要我們能夠想得到，提得出來，就可以納入方案。第一步沒有考
ZW02n0000_p0115a09_##慮到，還可以在第二步補充。
ZW02n0000_p0115a10_##<p,0,2>我對這是有充分的信心，但有一個前提，就是必須有宗教局來
ZW02n0000_p0115a11_##抓這件事。時間不用那麼長，成果也可以是階段的，比如一年出一
ZW02n0000_p0115a12_##次成果，或陸續發表。在這一點上，電子出版物有它的優點。當
ZW02n0000_p0115a13_##然，也有問題，比如盜版。但我們不能因為怕盜版就不搞了，就封
ZW02n0000_p0115a14_##閉技術。
ZW02n0000_p0115a15_##
ZW02n0000_p0115a16_##<p,0,2>熊國楨（中華書局副總編輯）：我個人對編印大藏經非常贊成
ZW02n0000_p0115a17_##與擁護，很關心此事。也關心有什麼新的動向。在此想介紹一下
ZW02n0000_p0115a18_##中華書局在佛教典籍整理方面所做的工作。也談談我從事該工作
ZW02n0000_p0115a19_##的一些感想。
ZW02n0000_p0115a20_##<p,0,2>中華書局從1978年開始，搞了一套「中國佛教典籍選刊」，當
ZW02n0000_p0115a21_##時的考慮是佛教界的一些老專家年事已高，佛教典籍的整理需要
ZW02n0000_p0115a22_##抓緊進行。否則很多寶貴的精神財富要被帶走了。大藏經又很
ZW02n0000_p0115a23_##多，所以從搶救遺產的角度，選擇大藏經中最重要的若干部，請健
ZW02n0000_p0115a24_##在的佛教專家做註釋、整理工作。到現在，當時定的22種，祇出版
ZW02n0000_p0115a25_##了9種。其中相當一部分僅僅是校勘與標點，沒有註釋。有的稿
ZW02n0000_p0115a26_##子雖然很小，但經過了好幾個人的手。比如《童蒙止觀》，開始約的
ZW02n0000_p0115a27_##是哲學研究所的談壯飛先生，但還沒有開筆，就去世了。後來巨贊
ZW02n0000_p0115a28_##法師接手，但還沒有動手，患了腦溢血。最後是金陵刻經處的李安
ZW02n0000_p0116a01_##先生完成的。這部小書，帶註祇有六萬多字，經過三位高僧大德的
ZW02n0000_p0116a02_##手纔完成。這裡的曲折艱難，不是一言半語能夠說得清楚的。比
ZW02n0000_p0116a03_##如佛教典籍的標點，就不是一件很簡單的事。我們的選刊中有一
ZW02n0000_p0116a04_##本禪宗的語錄，請的是某大學的一位老專家，他既是文學史的專
ZW02n0000_p0116a05_##家，也是禪宗史的專家。該書他交稿後，我們請編輯作了許多修改
ZW02n0000_p0116a06_##加工。但出版後，還是受到很多批評。首先是四川大學項楚先生，
ZW02n0000_p0116a07_##寫文章指出該書標點錯誤五百例。後來我們又陸續收到一些讀者
ZW02n0000_p0116a08_##的批評意見，至今為止，這本書因標點方面的錯誤累計挖改二千多
ZW02n0000_p0116a09_##處。而這本禪宗語錄還是大家讀得最多，最通行的一種。這樣的
ZW02n0000_p0116a10_##語錄，標點起來還如此困難；則其它一些不常見的佛教典籍的艱難
ZW02n0000_p0116a11_##程度，就可以想見了。這套書還有這樣的情況，有的明知底本沒有
ZW02n0000_p0116a12_##選對，但沒有辦法，因為作者已經去世，是遺稿，祇有先把它出版出
ZW02n0000_p0116a13_##來再說。有的註釋是學生根據老師的成果寫的，因老師年事太高，
ZW02n0000_p0116a14_##寫不了了，學生來寫也可以，總比沒有強。對這些不太成熟的東
ZW02n0000_p0116a15_##西，我們也祇好先把它出版出來。就這樣，至今一共纔出版了9
ZW02n0000_p0116a16_##本。當然，出版速度慢，也有我們出版社工作方面的問題。
ZW02n0000_p0116a17_##<p,0,2>總之，佛教典籍的整理，不是一件簡單的事。首先，文字的勘
ZW02n0000_p0116a18_##定就是大問題。佛典中有古體字，有俗體字，都應該整理為正字。
ZW02n0000_p0116a19_##這纔能成為標準的版本。如保留很多異體字、很多現在已經淘汰
ZW02n0000_p0116a20_##的俗體字，則這種版本就沒有時代特色。有些佛經中的術語是音
ZW02n0000_p0116a21_##譯，這種音譯因人而異，是否要統一？有的經，不同時代均有傳本，
ZW02n0000_p0116a22_##由於時代不同，產生一些差別，如有的稱「唐音」，有的稱「晉音」，有
ZW02n0000_p0116a23_##的稱「宋音」。如果要恢復原文，也要做一番文字考訂工作。另外
ZW02n0000_p0116a24_##就是斷句。佛經中各種佛教名相、名詞、概念比較多。日本的《大
ZW02n0000_p0116a25_##正藏》有很多錯誤是因為對中華文化不瞭解，有隔膜，所以破句。
ZW02n0000_p0116a26_##中國人來整理，至少在名相、概念方面不要出現錯誤，不要斷錯句，
ZW02n0000_p0116a27_##例如把一個詞分成兩截等等。《大正藏》中有很多這樣的錯誤。至
ZW02n0000_p0116a28_##於剛纔有的專家談到的它的排印方面的錯誤，那是工廠的問題，不
ZW02n0000_p0117a01_##是整理的問題。斷句後還有標點的問題。斷句對不見得標點也
ZW02n0000_p0117a02_##對。現在出版的一些佛教典籍中，包括白話翻譯，很多似是而非的
ZW02n0000_p0117a03_##東西。自己就沒有讀懂。如果這樣整理，等於是糟蹋古籍。這是
ZW02n0000_p0117a04_##破壞，不是建設。大藏經的整理是應該用非常嚴謹求實的態度來
ZW02n0000_p0117a05_##做的一項很嚴肅的工作。要動員相當的人力，這工作也不是一般
ZW02n0000_p0117a06_##的認識繁體字的人就能夠做的。一是要求古籍整理的基本技術的
ZW02n0000_p0117a07_##訓練；一是要有相當深厚的佛學修養。兩者缺一不可。而現在要
ZW02n0000_p0117a08_##找一批符合這兩個條件的人，不是很容易。中華書局出版標點本
ZW02n0000_p0117a09_##「二十四史」，當年調集了大批歷史學家，集中進行。現在我們是否
ZW02n0000_p0117a10_##具備這樣的條件，能夠調集相當一批符合上述條件的人，全心全意
ZW02n0000_p0117a11_##地做這件事？否則，十年、二十年也出不來。我們現在出版的《中
ZW02n0000_p0117a12_##華大藏經》是任繼愈先生掛帥、指導，具體工作是李富華先生、方廣
ZW02n0000_p0117a13_##錩先生組織一幫人來做。先後參加工作的有三百多人，除了宗教
ZW02n0000_p0117a14_##所的專業人員外，大多數是退休的教師和幹部。他們在這兩方面，
ZW02n0000_p0117a15_##都有先天的不足。所以祇能做機械的比勘，列出異同，無法做評
ZW02n0000_p0117a16_##述，確定是非。當時的條件祇能做到這一步。現在要搞一個超過
ZW02n0000_p0117a17_##《大正藏》的佛教大藏經，這個標準絕對不行。《大正藏》收的經典
ZW02n0000_p0117a18_##多，再一個它是鉛排，相當多的經集中在一本書中，上下三欄，校勘
ZW02n0000_p0117a19_##記採用比較簡潔的方式，用一些符號，都能在當頁查到。所以流通
ZW02n0000_p0117a20_##方便，也很廣，世界各地都可以找到。中國的一些大藏經，版本很
ZW02n0000_p0117a21_##好，但是木刻的，卷帙太多，用起來不方便。《大正藏》的特點就是
ZW02n0000_p0117a22_##方便實用。但在標點斷句方面的確很不可靠。有的經好一點，但
ZW02n0000_p0117a23_##多數都靠不住。包括一些很重要的基本典籍，破句都很厲害。錯
ZW02n0000_p0117a24_##字也多，有些是因為不懂，生造一些根本沒有的字。所以，要說超
ZW02n0000_p0117a25_##過《大正藏》，也很容易，因為中國人做這件事，有自己的民族文化
ZW02n0000_p0117a26_##傳統，有優越條件。祇要能夠集中相當的人，就可以做這件事。至
ZW02n0000_p0117a27_##少保證標點斷句基本正確。這不難做到。但有兩個問題：
ZW02n0000_p0117a28_##<p,0,2>一、投資問題。沒有相當大的投資不行。82年做《中華大藏
ZW02n0000_p0118a01_##經》，那時主要是古籍規劃小組李一氓同志支持，每年撥十幾萬，中
ZW02n0000_p0118a02_##華大藏經編輯局就能夠做事，不過那也就是一點辦公經費。現在
ZW02n0000_p0118a03_##十幾萬絕對辦不了事，資料要資料費，複印要複印費，人頭費也不
ZW02n0000_p0118a04_##得了。投資問題怎麼解決？這祇好由宗教局出面來協調。李一氓
ZW02n0000_p0118a05_##同志辦這件事時，當時政治歷史條件不一樣，氣候不一樣，所以當
ZW02n0000_p0118a06_##時採取不爭論、辦實事的辦法，選取《趙城金藏》做底本影印，再用
ZW02n0000_p0118a07_##較好本子作校勘，出一個在歷史上能夠站得住的版本。也就把這
ZW02n0000_p0118a08_##件事作下來了。現在來討論這件事就不能這麼簡單。再搞影印，
ZW02n0000_p0118a09_##意義不大。排印的話，投資至少要好幾千萬。現在一方面很多大
ZW02n0000_p0118a10_##型的文化工程重複浪費，是出於贏利的目的，而不是出於文化積累
ZW02n0000_p0118a11_##的目的。另一方面，有些很重要的文化建設工作，無人來出錢。大
ZW02n0000_p0118a12_##藏經就屬於應該有人來組織，來做，來花錢的事。此事由宗教局出
ZW02n0000_p0118a13_##面，加上佛教協會，各方面一起呼籲，還是有希望的。
ZW02n0000_p0118a14_##<p,0,2>第二大困難，是人力問題。要集中相當一批有佛學修養的，有
ZW02n0000_p0118a15_##古籍整理基本技能的同志，專門從事這一工作。包括領頭的人，必
ZW02n0000_p0118a16_##須全身心地投入到這個工作中，而不是僅僅掛名。僅僅掛名做不
ZW02n0000_p0118a17_##好這件事。他要具體研究版本，研究校勘，研究斷句，要具體指導。
ZW02n0000_p0118a18_##我覺得木刻藏經中金陵刻經處的《藏要》本比較靠得住。當時就有
ZW02n0000_p0118a19_##楊文會、歐陽竟無、呂澂他們做這件事。這個本子確實靠得住，不
ZW02n0000_p0118a20_##會誤導。也有錯誤，比較起來，在木刻版藏經中是最可靠的。我們
ZW02n0000_p0118a21_##現在能否集中這些人力？這是一個很現實的問題。現在市場經
ZW02n0000_p0118a22_##濟，大家忙的是生存問題，溫飽問題，這樣一種氣氛做不了這個事。
ZW02n0000_p0118a23_##要做這件事就需要有點犧牲精神，十年、二十年，就是坐冷板凳，就
ZW02n0000_p0118a24_##搞這一項工作，十年、二十年以後纔能出成果。沒有犧牲精神不
ZW02n0000_p0118a25_##行。現在佛學界的專家，不少人年事已經相當高了，年輕一輩能不
ZW02n0000_p0118a26_##能踏下心來做這件事？這要做大量的組織工作，思想工作，也要切
ZW02n0000_p0118a27_##實解決他們的物質福利待遇問題。否則不安心。這項工作週期很
ZW02n0000_p0118a28_##長，編校的工作，不要說五年，十年能夠完成就算不錯。出版再加
ZW02n0000_p0119a01_##五年。邊編邊出。週期長，沒有相當的資金來支持就做不下去。
ZW02n0000_p0119a02_##資金、人力等都是實際運行中會遇到的實實在在的事。比如在座
ZW02n0000_p0119a03_##這麼多專家，但究竟哪位同志出來做這件事？我看願意投入的人
ZW02n0000_p0119a04_##大概不多。真正能夠勝任的恐怕也不是太多。因為好多同志是搞
ZW02n0000_p0119a05_##佛教史的，或者是搞佛教理論的，或者是從事佛教宣傳的。而真正
ZW02n0000_p0119a06_##搞古籍整理的，搞佛教典籍整理的，這樣的人比較難找。從全國範
ZW02n0000_p0119a07_##圍來調，恐怕都得費點勁。當然，可以培養一些年輕人。比如從古
ZW02n0000_p0119a08_##典文獻專業的畢業生中培養一批，邊[干>幹]邊學。但這些實際問題都
ZW02n0000_p0119a09_##非解決不可，否則啟動不了。
ZW02n0000_p0119a10_##<p,0,2>這件事要認真去抓，如果不抓緊，真可能「黃」了。真有這個擔
ZW02n0000_p0119a11_##心。
ZW02n0000_p0119a12_##
ZW02n0000_p0119a13_##<p,0,2>葛兆光（清華大學教授）：上面大家談了很多。假定這個項目
ZW02n0000_p0119a14_##最終能夠立項，那麼我建議兩點：
ZW02n0000_p0119a15_##<p,0,2>一、很多人提到關於人的問題，尤其熊國楨先生講了很悲觀的
ZW02n0000_p0119a16_##話。我認為，這項工作的確需要有人來做，而且兩頭的人不能做。
ZW02n0000_p0119a17_##一是現在研究很有成就的人，他們都很忙，實際上也未必肯對著電
ZW02n0000_p0119a18_##腦屏幕一字一字地去看。另一頭，沒有佛教知識，沒有古籍整理常
ZW02n0000_p0119a19_##識的人也不能做。所以是不是可以採取辦碩士班與博士班的方
ZW02n0000_p0119a20_##法。祇有學生纔能夠給你非常認真的辦事。這是否可以由宗教局
ZW02n0000_p0119a21_##出面，與教委協商，在某大學辦一個試點的班，從本科到碩士、博
ZW02n0000_p0119a22_##士。學生們可以非常認真地來做這件事，實在說，如果他們能夠認
ZW02n0000_p0119a23_##真地做出來，人材也培養得差不多了。另一個方法，是否可以在佛
ZW02n0000_p0119a24_##學院系統中，找一些素質比較好的學生。這樣，僧俗兩界都有人參
ZW02n0000_p0119a25_##加，事情纔真正有人做。說老實話，你要我現在坐下來慢慢校一本
ZW02n0000_p0119a26_##書，恐怕也抽不出時間來。
ZW02n0000_p0119a27_##<p,0,2>二、既然要做，是否在做的過程中同時完成一個目錄提要。劉
ZW02n0000_p0119a28_##向校書，每校完一本都寫一篇書錄。如果我們也這樣做，大藏經編
ZW02n0000_p0120a01_##纂出來，大藏經提要也編纂出來了。這樣做的好處是：要做好提
ZW02n0000_p0120a02_##要，他就必須認真地看書。還可以把若干種目錄，若干種藏經的典
ZW02n0000_p0120a03_##籍都附在底下，便於查找。我們可以學習清朝人編纂《四庫全書》
ZW02n0000_p0120a04_##的辦法。其實以前的人，像歐陽竟無，也做提要。有這樣一個東
ZW02n0000_p0120a05_##西，將來做整理工作等都很方便。
ZW02n0000_p0120a06_##
ZW02n0000_p0120a07_##<p,0,2>淨慧（中國佛教協會副會長）：聽了大家的意見，很受啟發。佛
ZW02n0000_p0120a08_##教是世界三大宗教之一，佛教文化也是世界文化的一部分，是人類
ZW02n0000_p0120a09_##文明的重要組成部分。新編漢文大藏經也因此有著重要的意義與
ZW02n0000_p0120a10_##切實的必要性。在科技文明高度發達的今天，利用現代科技文明
ZW02n0000_p0120a11_##來重新處理大藏經的有關問題，的確是一個好的機遇。
ZW02n0000_p0120a12_##<p,0,2>在這次新編漢文大藏經的設想方面，有兩種樣式。一種是印
ZW02n0000_p0120a13_##刷版，書冊本，一種是光電版，電子本。在這兩種版本的選擇上，從
ZW02n0000_p0120a14_##佛教的理念來講，書冊本更重要。佛教把經典視為法寶，供人閱讀
ZW02n0000_p0120a15_##學習，所謂聞、思、修，其中就離不開書本。除了閱讀學習，還用來
ZW02n0000_p0120a16_##供養。每個寺院都有藏經樓，這就是供養法寶所在的地方。三寶
ZW02n0000_p0120a17_##有住持三寶，亦即佛像、經典與修持佛法的僧團。經典是住持三寶
ZW02n0000_p0120a18_##之一。考慮到這一因素，我們在新編漢文大藏經編纂開始時，應該
ZW02n0000_p0120a19_##把書冊本放在第一位。此外，現在利用電腦閱讀、查詢的普及率不
ZW02n0000_p0120a20_##高，真正使用電腦的人數也相當有限。對寺廟裡的僧尼來說就更
ZW02n0000_p0120a21_##是如此了。
ZW02n0000_p0120a22_##<p,0,2>現在應用的書冊本大藏經有好幾種，其中最普及的是日本的
ZW02n0000_p0120a23_##《大正藏》。《大正藏》從日本傳入中國是解放前。解放後傳入的大
ZW02n0000_p0120a24_##多為臺灣的翻印本。大約有1000部左右。使用上有一定的優勢。
ZW02n0000_p0120a25_##方便，數量適中，兩個書櫃就裝下了。資料集中。儘管標點有錯
ZW02n0000_p0120a26_##誤，但有了句讀，讀起來方便多了。比較起來，我們的《中華大藏
ZW02n0000_p0120a27_##經》就沒有這個優勢。佛經，特別是很多古文的東西，現代人接觸
ZW02n0000_p0120a28_##起來像天書一樣。你再沒有句讀，使人們實在沒法看，受到很大的
ZW02n0000_p0121a01_##局限。因此，我們新編一部書冊本的大藏經，要超過《大正藏》，這
ZW02n0000_p0121a02_##是毫無疑問的，但我們也要利用它的成果。人類的文明成果是大
ZW02n0000_p0121a03_##家共同分享。我們中國人在歷史上創造了儒釋道三家的文明，現
ZW02n0000_p0121a04_##在世界各國都在分享。世界各國所創造的文明，我們中國人也在
ZW02n0000_p0121a05_##分享。很多科技文明，是西方人創造的。日本人在佛典研究、佛學
ZW02n0000_p0121a06_##研究方面的確取得很多成果。我們中國的學者們都在分享這些成
ZW02n0000_p0121a07_##果。這也體現了中華文化的包容性，中華民族的包容性。因為日
ZW02n0000_p0121a08_##本文化本身就是儒釋道三家大文化的一部分。因此，對於日本人
ZW02n0000_p0121a09_##取得的成果，我們一方面是接受，另一方面是歡喜讚歎。
ZW02n0000_p0121a10_##<p,0,2>要編纂新的漢文大藏經，除了在資料上要超過它以外，在編
ZW02n0000_p0121a11_##排、校勘、體例、分類等方面都要有所突破，纔能說超過它。我想在
ZW02n0000_p0121a12_##資料方面肯定能夠超過它；在體例方面我們也有自己的一些想法，
ZW02n0000_p0121a13_##另外，臺灣的《佛光大藏經》的很多做法我們可以吸收。關於體例
ZW02n0000_p0121a14_##與分類，我建議，等我們這件事真正立項以後，再開專門的會議來
ZW02n0000_p0121a15_##進行研究，這不是一下子能夠解決的，可能有各種分歧意見。最後
ZW02n0000_p0121a16_##總得拿出一個大體上既符合傳統，又與現代學術接軌的分類方法
ZW02n0000_p0121a17_##與體例，來新編我們書冊版的大藏經。至於電子版的大藏經，昨天
ZW02n0000_p0121a18_##與小盧說，電子版大藏經的分類方法比較好解決，它可以採取各種
ZW02n0000_p0121a19_##各樣的分類方法。到那時，分類祇是一個框架，可以按照各種方式
ZW02n0000_p0121a20_##來處理。可以按照《開元錄》編排，也可以按照《閱藏知津》編排，或
ZW02n0000_p0121a21_##其它新的分類都可以，不受某一個模式的局限。所以電子版分類
ZW02n0000_p0121a22_##的問題不是很大。而書冊版的分類要好好討論。拿出來後，要真
ZW02n0000_p0121a23_##正能夠超越前人，跟同時代的相比也要有自己的優勢，這纔能體現
ZW02n0000_p0121a24_##出做這項工作的優勢與意義所在。
ZW02n0000_p0121a25_##<p,0,2>這件事應該怎麼做呢？從歷史來看，如此浩大的文化工程祇
ZW02n0000_p0121a26_##有在盛世纔能夠做得了。在當今改革開放的大好形勢下，文化政
ZW02n0000_p0121a27_##策、宗教政策相當開明，做這件事正是適逢其時。歷史上修大藏
ZW02n0000_p0121a28_##經，有官辦、私辦兩種。官辦為主，私辦也不少，還有私辦公助，或
ZW02n0000_p0122a01_##稱民辦官助。就是先由佛教界發起，其後得到國家的承認，給予認
ZW02n0000_p0122a02_##可。我想，佛教文化是有它的共性，但它之所以重要，我作為一個
ZW02n0000_p0122a03_##僧人，認為主要在於它的個性。個性就是信仰。祇有信仰層面能
ZW02n0000_p0122a04_##夠存在，佛教的存在纔有必要。沒有信仰的存在，佛教僅僅是一種
ZW02n0000_p0122a05_##文化，它對人類的貢獻也就大打折扣。基於這樣一種理念，新編漢
ZW02n0000_p0122a06_##文大藏經能否採取這種做法：民辦，得到政府的支持，政府在政策
ZW02n0000_p0122a07_##上給予保證由民間來具體實施。從我僧人本位的角度來講，應該
ZW02n0000_p0122a08_##以具有信仰的人為主組成一個班子，與學術界、文化界共同來做這
ZW02n0000_p0122a09_##件事。祇有這樣纔能調動廣大信徒的參與意識。佛教界的參與意
ZW02n0000_p0122a10_##識如何，是我們這件事業能否取得真正成功的保證。既然國家財
ZW02n0000_p0122a11_##政一下撥出巨款資助此事有困難，那麼祇有調動佛教界的參與意
ZW02n0000_p0122a12_##識，經過幾年的努力，來完成這件事。昨天聽到對《房山石經》的介
ZW02n0000_p0122a13_##紹，它歷時一千多年，不管朝代怎麼改變，這件事一朝一朝一代一
ZW02n0000_p0122a14_##代堅持下來。昨天還講到《趙城金藏》。該藏是一個女居士崔法珍
ZW02n0000_p0122a15_##斷臂募集資金，而後刻成的。現在成了《開寶藏》以後最具有版本
ZW02n0000_p0122a16_##價值的佛教藏經。這就是信仰帶動的。從我們民族來講，沒有共
ZW02n0000_p0122a17_##產主義信仰，民族要真正站立起來是不可能的；從宗教來講，沒有
ZW02n0000_p0122a18_##信仰也不可能。宗教文化事業有共性，有個性。共性的部分，全社
ZW02n0000_p0122a19_##會都可以分享。但個性的部分不可能全社會分享，祇是那些有信
ZW02n0000_p0122a20_##仰的人，纔可能更積極，更虔誠的投入。所以我認為可以採取民辦
ZW02n0000_p0122a21_##官助的形式。在這個前提下，我們可以看看臺灣《佛光大藏經》的
ZW02n0000_p0122a22_##做法。佛光山當然有它的條件。主要有兩條：一是經濟力量雄厚；
ZW02n0000_p0122a23_##二是佛教人才多而且集中。現在修藏，經濟還不是很重要的問題，
ZW02n0000_p0122a24_##最重要的還是人的問題。《佛光大藏經》從性質上講是民間的，不
ZW02n0000_p0122a25_##是官辦的。是以佛光山系統作為依託來做這件事。我們來做這件
ZW02n0000_p0122a26_##事，也應該考慮可以依託的一個大的寺院或名山。因為他們的經
ZW02n0000_p0122a27_##濟收入是常年固定的。能夠讓他認同這件事，真正參與這件事，幾
ZW02n0000_p0122a28_##年的時間其它事情不做，整個參與此事，就能夠做起來。祇是簡單
ZW02n0000_p0123a01_##地號召大家捐款，這恐怕也不一定能夠靠得住。
ZW02n0000_p0123a02_##<p,0,2>編修新的大藏經還是不要太擴大。比如收入南傳佛法的東
ZW02n0000_p0123a03_##西、藏傳佛教的東西，我主張基本上還是以現有的漢文資料為主。
ZW02n0000_p0123a04_##如果真的搞南傳佛教的互譯或藏傳佛教的互譯，這件事就會變得
ZW02n0000_p0123a05_##曠日持久。文化事業是持續不斷的，也是應該有階段性的。在現
ZW02n0000_p0123a06_##階段，還是以現有的漢文資料作為應收的主要資料。互譯的事現
ZW02n0000_p0123a07_##在也可以做，也可以以後再做，再搞續編也可以。
ZW02n0000_p0123a08_##
ZW02n0000_p0123a09_##<p,0,2>蘇晉仁（中央民族大學教授）：大藏經工程可說是一個千秋偉
ZW02n0000_p0123a10_##業。現在已經到了20世紀末了，在這個時候，我們應該在前人的
ZW02n0000_p0123a11_##基礎上，把過去的藏經以及藏外的東西做一個總結，做一個結論性
ZW02n0000_p0123a12_##的工作，把過去的東西都包括在內。這樣，對於當今時代，對中國
ZW02n0000_p0123a13_##文化都將是極大的貢獻。
ZW02n0000_p0123a14_##<p,0,2>我們一般用的都是《大正藏》，因為它有點句，有校勘。當然還
ZW02n0000_p0123a15_##存在很多問題，但畢竟給我們提供了很多方便。另外，我還想到一
ZW02n0000_p0123a16_##點，就是《大正藏》有它的特點，它不僅吸收前人的著作，還突出了
ZW02n0000_p0123a17_##日本人的著作。我統計了一下，它收的譯經（主要是中國翻譯的）
ZW02n0000_p0123a18_##有32卷1692部；中國人的撰著，祇有22卷666部；收入的日本人
ZW02n0000_p0123a19_##的佛教撰著，也有32卷，此外還有圖像12卷。我們現在編纂《中
ZW02n0000_p0123a20_##華大藏經》，要突出中國人的特色，這樣纔能把中國歷代的佛教文
ZW02n0000_p0123a21_##化表現得更加全面，這纔能使這部藏經真正表現為是我們今天中
ZW02n0000_p0123a22_##國人的藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0123a23_##<p,0,2>另外，我有個設想，就這個藏經的收經內容而言，首先是截止
ZW02n0000_p0123a24_##年限。是否到解放前（1949年）為止，或者到清末為止。就現在
ZW02n0000_p0123a25_##看，可以到49年以前為止，因從清末到49年還有些著作。當然，
ZW02n0000_p0123a26_##收的時候對不同時間段的典籍可以適度掌握寬嚴。其次是收的範
ZW02n0000_p0123a27_##圍。這可以分為幾個方面，比如說著述方面，宗派方面，歷史方面，
ZW02n0000_p0123a28_##議論方面。以至過去沒有收入的山志、寺志、年譜、詩文集等等，都
ZW02n0000_p0124a01_##應該收進去，不應遺漏。如出家人的詩文集，過去也收，但比較有
ZW02n0000_p0124a02_##限。我們這次則應該比較全面地收進去。
ZW02n0000_p0124a03_##<p,0,2>另外，對於外國人的著作，像朝鮮人、日本人著作等，我們收不
ZW02n0000_p0124a04_##收？如果都收，那就與《大正藏》重複了。我想要有一個界限。就
ZW02n0000_p0124a05_##是古代到中國來過的，不管古代藏經有沒有，都可以收。像弘法大
ZW02n0000_p0124a06_##師那樣。還有，到日本去的中國高僧的著作，也應該全部收入。事
ZW02n0000_p0124a07_##實上，那些著作也都是漢文的。
ZW02n0000_p0124a08_##<p,0,2>關於版本，我考慮，現在如果重新來標點分段，會有一定的困
ZW02n0000_p0124a09_##難。想一下完成不行，恐怕會曠日持久。是否可以用比較簡單的
ZW02n0000_p0124a10_##辦法，比如金陵刻經處刻的經，差不多都有句讀，就採用它的句讀
ZW02n0000_p0124a11_##好了。因為如果要重新標點，恐怕工程太大。金陵刻經處本沒有
ZW02n0000_p0124a12_##的，我們再做補充。至於校勘，恐怕還要再考慮。比如《大正藏》、
ZW02n0000_p0124a13_##《中華藏》都是死校。這樣校當然也有用處，但有一定的局限性。
ZW02n0000_p0124a14_##它沒有活校，祇是提供資料而已，沒有確定這句話到底應該用哪個
ZW02n0000_p0124a15_##字。我們現在真正校的話，應該是活校。當然這個工作很浩大，很
ZW02n0000_p0124a16_##麻煩。
ZW02n0000_p0124a17_##<p,0,2>在編排時，最好對某一個經，把它的有關著作都放在一起。形
ZW02n0000_p0124a18_##成一個體系。這部分書以後也可以單賣，便於讀者學習。這樣也
ZW02n0000_p0124a19_##收得比較全。像《楞嚴》、《華嚴》，都可以自成體系。
ZW02n0000_p0124a20_##<p,0,2>日本《大正藏》有一個小本目錄，其後有一個「會員名錄」，實際
ZW02n0000_p0124a21_##上就是出錢的人，買書的人。我們以後也可以採取這個辦法。誰
ZW02n0000_p0124a22_##捐了款，誰買了書，我們把他的名字列在裡面。也就是對那些願意
ZW02n0000_p0124a23_##做功德，願意買書的人，進行表揚。

ZW02n0000_p0124a25_##<p,0,2>湯一介（北京大學哲學系教授）書面發言：對編纂新的大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0124a26_##表示熱烈支持。新編的這部大藏經要超過日本的《大正藏》，成為
ZW02n0000_p0124a27_##最完備、最權威的大藏經。這就要求必須做到兩點：一、要選好底
ZW02n0000_p0124a28_##本，認真總結編纂《中華大藏經》的經驗與得失。二、必須要有現代
ZW02n0000_p0125a01_##標點，做好校勘。
ZW02n0000_p0125a02_##
ZW02n0000_p0125a03_##<p,0,2>周紹良（中國佛教協會副會長）：編輯大藏經是一件很好的事，
ZW02n0000_p0125a04_##我很支持，希望它能夠辦成。這也是一件大事，我談幾點意見：
ZW02n0000_p0125a05_##<p,0,2>一、我們立足於今天來編纂大藏經，就必須突破過去。從《大
ZW02n0000_p0125a06_##周目錄》到《閱藏知津》，從《開寶藏》到《大正藏》，這麼多目錄、藏
ZW02n0000_p0125a07_##經，老實說是炒冷飯。體例也沒有突破，沒有變化。大家翻來覆
ZW02n0000_p0125a08_##去，還是這些相同的經典。現在我們要突破，否則顯不出精彩來。
ZW02n0000_p0125a09_##古代藏經的一大缺點是白文本太多，沒有像儒家《十三經》那樣整
ZW02n0000_p0125a10_##理。儒家《十三經註疏》本流通後，白文本就不流通了。我們要突
ZW02n0000_p0125a11_##破，纔能編纂出劃時代的大藏經。
ZW02n0000_p0125a12_##<p,0,2>二、大藏經，祇限於佛言法語。我們可以不搞大藏經，應該搞
ZW02n0000_p0125a13_##佛教全書。它與大藏經形式不同，含義不同，立意也不同。大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0125a14_##有取捨，有入藏、不入藏的問題，我們可以沒有這個問題。如果我
ZW02n0000_p0125a15_##們限制在「大藏經」這個名稱中，太窄了。應該有新的觀點，新的立
ZW02n0000_p0125a16_##腳點。
ZW02n0000_p0125a17_##<p,0,2>三、我們是否還採用傳統排列方法？我們應該定出新的排列
ZW02n0000_p0125a18_##次序來。這纔能體現新的精神。蘇晉仁教授提出「以疏隸書」，我
ZW02n0000_p0125a19_##認為可以考慮。
ZW02n0000_p0125a20_##<p,0,2>四、必須先編出一個書目，因為現在不知道有多少書。《大正
ZW02n0000_p0125a21_##藏》中提到的書，現在不少根本找不到了，有的可能在哪裡存在著，
ZW02n0000_p0125a22_##但我們不知道。所以要調查，登記，編一本中國現存的藏經目錄、
ZW02n0000_p0125a23_##佛教典籍目錄。現在浙江圖書館正在從事這一工作。他們來找過
ZW02n0000_p0125a24_##我。四、五年前，我對這事有興趣，現在沒有精力了。應該入藏的
ZW02n0000_p0125a25_##書是有，但必須先去找。《大正藏》的書並非都很好。我就存有一
ZW02n0000_p0125a26_##本書，書名與《大正藏》本同，前半部分殘缺，中間部分與《大正藏》
ZW02n0000_p0125a27_##本相同，但後半部分與《大正藏》本不同。《大正藏》本有時還有錯
ZW02n0000_p0125a28_##字。如果還用《大正藏》做底本，就會跟著錯，自己還不知道。這就
ZW02n0000_p0126a01_##很危險。因此，先把訪書的工作做起來，目錄編纂出來，這很重要。
ZW02n0000_p0126a02_##<p,0,2>五、有人談到，由宗教局牽頭，成立一個機構，向國家立項。我
ZW02n0000_p0126a03_##覺得這樣做太渺茫。什麼時候纔能夠爭取到？不知道。我覺得淨
ZW02n0000_p0126a04_##慧法師提的民辦公助的方法很好。我們先辦起來，向宗教局立案。
ZW02n0000_p0126a05_##宗教局先承認。成，望下走；不成，解散完事。成立這樣一個民辦
ZW02n0000_p0126a06_##的機構很有好處，我們可以在海內外爭取合作與資助。有形的資
ZW02n0000_p0126a07_##助與無形的資助。有形的資助（錢）隨時可以號召，無形的資助（人
ZW02n0000_p0126a08_##力、出主意，資料）更重要。我認為可以先成立這樣一個機構，同時
ZW02n0000_p0126a09_##把訪書、編目工作先做起來，並進一步籌劃如何進行。這樣，雖然
ZW02n0000_p0126a10_##還沒有成，但已經開始向前走了。
ZW02n0000_p0126a11_##
ZW02n0000_p0126a12_##<p,0,2>樓宇烈（北京大學哲學系教授）：重新編纂大藏經是非常重要
ZW02n0000_p0126a13_##的一項工作，很有必要。我們現在能夠看到的古代大藏經有三十
ZW02n0000_p0126a14_##部左右。新編大藏經，我看到臺灣編的，就有五、六部，大陸有《中
ZW02n0000_p0126a15_##華大藏經》。我認為我們現在編纂大藏經，要考慮究竟從那個方面
ZW02n0000_p0126a16_##著眼。我比較傾向於把大藏經作為備查的資料庫來使用。如果
ZW02n0000_p0126a17_##讀，還要靠各種流通本。但建立佛教文化的資料庫很重要，這個資
ZW02n0000_p0126a18_##料庫也可以成為各廟的鎮山之寶。各大圖書館能夠有這麼一套，
ZW02n0000_p0126a19_##就很解決問題。現在有很多資料真的找不到。實在說，一部《大正
ZW02n0000_p0126a20_##藏》是不夠用的，很多東西要從其它地方去找。當然，反過來說，我
ZW02n0000_p0126a21_##們再怎麼努力，也不可能收羅完全。祇能是相對的。入藏時限可
ZW02n0000_p0126a22_##以放寬，可以到現在，但選擇要從嚴。特別是民國以後的，否則太
ZW02n0000_p0126a23_##濫。一個圖書館也不可能什麼書都收。它也做不到。
ZW02n0000_p0126a24_##<p,0,2>由於是備查，所以我不太主張標點。對佛教典籍的標點，我深
ZW02n0000_p0126a25_##有體會，不太好辦。中國的古文，佛經的翻譯，根本不能用現代的
ZW02n0000_p0126a26_##新式標點去做標點。一標點就把它原來的語氣、文風全部破壞了。
ZW02n0000_p0126a27_##如果沒有親身體會，從理論上講，是應該新式標點。但祇要自己實
ZW02n0000_p0126a28_##際動手一做，你就知道不是那麼一回事。不要說古代佛經，就是嚴
ZW02n0000_p0127a01_##復翻譯的著作，也同樣。我也做過嚴復著作的校點。用新式標點
ZW02n0000_p0127a02_##都很難。因為它是四六文，用新式標點一標，原來的文風、氣息全
ZW02n0000_p0127a03_##部沒有了。所以我認為，最多做句讀。就這樣恐怕好多還做不過
ZW02n0000_p0127a04_##來，或者做不了。金陵刻經處的本子是句讀了，但也有好多都空
ZW02n0000_p0127a05_##著。因為他圈不下來，不知道在哪裡圈。包括《藏要》，也有不少地
ZW02n0000_p0127a06_##方沒有斷掉。這當然應該允許。所以，如果用新式標點，不僅工夫
ZW02n0000_p0127a07_##很大，恐怕將來錯誤百出，還誤導閱讀。所以能夠用句讀就很好，
ZW02n0000_p0127a08_##而且儘量保持它原來的文氣。如佛典四字一句。其實要從內容
ZW02n0000_p0127a09_##看，有些地方八字一句纔好，但古人的行文，人們的讀法，就是四字
ZW02n0000_p0127a10_##一頓，纔有味道。新式標點，是符合意思了，但沒有味道了。說實
ZW02n0000_p0127a11_##在的，看不懂的人，再新式標點，他也看不懂。需要研究的人，沒有
ZW02n0000_p0127a12_##標點，他也要研究，所以標點的工夫可以省。校勘，可以儘量利用
ZW02n0000_p0127a13_##現在已經有的。現有的當然並不都是正確的，但可以儘量借用。
ZW02n0000_p0127a14_##如果全部自己做，這個工夫也不得了。底本，是否可以用百納。不
ZW02n0000_p0127a15_##一定非要確定為某一個。哪個精，哪個好，我們就選那個。這樣更
ZW02n0000_p0127a16_##好一點，也可以省去很多校勘工作。比如我校過《房山石經》一個
ZW02n0000_p0127a17_##本子，其它藏經讀不通的，《房山石經》可以讀通，這就應該選為底
ZW02n0000_p0127a18_##本。所以選底本應該不拘一格，百納。
ZW02n0000_p0127a19_##<p,0,2>從步驟來說，可以電子版先上。因為我們要出重排本，那首先
ZW02n0000_p0127a20_##需要錄入。錄入以後，校勘也罷，什麼也罷，都可以在電子版上做。
ZW02n0000_p0127a21_##有些可以先出一些階段性成果。然後回過來做書冊本。
ZW02n0000_p0127a22_##<p,0,2>事情很大，需要成立一個機構。我覺得這個機構依託在一個
ZW02n0000_p0127a23_##寺院有它的優越性。可以得到長期的資助，可以維持機構的日常
ZW02n0000_p0127a24_##運作。三十年代影印宋藏，也不是國家的機構。用這種方式比較
ZW02n0000_p0127a25_##有保證。工作人員應該固定，不能像《中華大藏經》那樣臨時聘用
ZW02n0000_p0127a26_##一些退休人員。編纂的過程也是培養人才的過程，我們應該吸收
ZW02n0000_p0127a27_##一些年輕人參加。現在的問題是我們培養了一些佛教人才，畢業
ZW02n0000_p0127a28_##以後無處分配工作。而這項工作很需要人，應該結合起來。我覺得
ZW02n0000_p0128a01_##佛教界缺乏一些眼光。各大寺院錢很多，可以多辦一些研究所，
ZW02n0000_p0128a02_##把我們培養的學生吸收過去。有好處。這些人也可以隨緣麼，願
ZW02n0000_p0128a03_##意出家就出家，願意做居士就做居士，願意當研究人員就當研究人
ZW02n0000_p0128a04_##員。這項工作，臨時請一些人來出出主意，這個可以。但真正做起
ZW02n0000_p0128a05_##來，不落實具體的地方，組織固定的工作人員，沒有周密的計劃，那
ZW02n0000_p0128a06_##還是困難，臨時措施是不行的。《大正藏》很多問題，也就出在當時
ZW02n0000_p0128a07_##找了一些臨時工作人員，每人包幾卷，進行點校，那問題就出來了。
ZW02n0000_p0128a08_##<p,0,2>如果能夠做出來這樣的藏經，意義太重大了。至今為止，還沒
ZW02n0000_p0128a09_##有這樣一個資料完全的大藏經，所以很有必要，很有需要。辛亥革
ZW02n0000_p0128a10_##命以前三億五字，我估計可能還要超過。當然編的時候，具體問題
ZW02n0000_p0128a11_##還要商量。有許多資料是重複的。
ZW02n0000_p0128a12_##<p,0,2>另外，就是能夠考慮在這同時編纂一個供大家閱讀的小的佛
ZW02n0000_p0128a13_##藏，真正是能夠實用的。像《藏要》性質之類的。無論信仰者、研究
ZW02n0000_p0128a14_##者，都可以閱讀。這可以考慮註釋等等。
ZW02n0000_p0128a15_##<p,0,2>收的範圍非常複雜。如果全部收，了不得。這與其它古籍整
ZW02n0000_p0128a16_##理也有重複的地方。現在浙江圖書館在做調查。圖書館以外的資
ZW02n0000_p0128a17_##料需要另外調查。現在可以先做起來。

ZW02n0000_p0129a02Q2#大藏經編纂及電腦化研討會紀要
ZW02n0000_p0129a03_##
ZW02n0000_p0129a04_##<p,0,2>今年4月9日至10日，「大藏經編纂及電腦化（大藏經工程）」
ZW02n0000_p0129a05_##研討會在北京召開。國務院宗教局、中國佛教協會、中國社科院世
ZW02n0000_p0129a06_##界宗教研究所、中國綜合開發研究院、北京部分高等院校和出版界
ZW02n0000_p0129a07_##的領導、佛教界人士、專家、學者共38人參加了會議。會議由國務
ZW02n0000_p0129a08_##院宗教局楊同祥副局長主持。
ZW02n0000_p0129a09_##<p,0,2>與會人員就大藏經工程的重要意義、目前這項工程在海內外
ZW02n0000_p0129a10_##進展情況以及大藏經編纂及電腦化工程的可行性和操作性等幾個
ZW02n0000_p0129a11_##專題進行了座談。
ZW02n0000_p0129a12_##<p,0,2>就大藏經工程的意義與必要性這一專題，中國佛教協會負責
ZW02n0000_p0129a13_##人及有關方面專家、學者刀述仁、吳立民、王志遠、王學信等作了發
ZW02n0000_p0129a14_##言。大家一致認為，大藏經工程有以下幾個方面的重要意義。
ZW02n0000_p0129a15_##<p,0,2>一、這是一項繼承、發掘和整理中華民族優秀的文化遺產的跨
ZW02n0000_p0129a16_##世紀工程。我們的祖國是有著悠久和深厚文化傳統的文明古國，
ZW02n0000_p0129a17_##古籍的搜求、編目整理是歷朝歷代的大事，從中吸收、融合了各種
ZW02n0000_p0129a18_##文化，融彙了各種學派，體現了中國文化恢宏的氣魄和博大的胸
ZW02n0000_p0129a19_##懷。中華民族之所以有如此的凝聚力，主要來源於各民族統一的
ZW02n0000_p0129a20_##文化。漢文佛教文獻（即大藏經）是中國古代文化典籍中數量最
ZW02n0000_p0129a21_##多、影響最大的部分之一，也是人類文化中十分重要的部分，在世
ZW02n0000_p0129a22_##界文明發展過程中產生過，並保持著重要的影響。目前，世界上最
ZW02n0000_p0129a23_##流通的大藏經傳本不是我們中國人編印的，而是日本二、三十年代
ZW02n0000_p0129a24_##編印的《大正藏》。特別是現在海外不少國家和地區在進行大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0129a25_##的電腦化工程，面對這種形勢，我們中國佛教界、學術界的專家、學
ZW02n0000_p0129a26_##者應該聯合起來，發揮社會主義優越性，編纂出最完備、最權威的
ZW02n0000_p0129a27_##我們自己的大藏經來。尤其是要充分利用電腦化技術，這應該是
ZW02n0000_p0129a28_##海內外華人都感到自豪的一項跨世紀工程。目前，中國是佛教的
ZW02n0000_p0130a01_##真正故鄉，完整的佛教典籍都保存在中國。經過十多年的改革開
ZW02n0000_p0130a02_##放，我國社會穩定、經濟繁榮，自強自立於世界民族之林。在這一
ZW02n0000_p0130a03_##偉大時代進行大藏經工程堪稱「盛世修典」。
ZW02n0000_p0130a04_##<p,0,2>二、大藏經工程可以引導宗教與社會主義社會相適應。大藏
ZW02n0000_p0130a05_##經工程可以提高宗教的品位，引導宗教的文化取向、倫理取向、哲
ZW02n0000_p0130a06_##學取向，為社會主義的精神文明建設服務。
ZW02n0000_p0130a07_##<p,0,2>三、大藏經的電腦化將對世界文化的發展做出貢獻。在國際
ZW02n0000_p0130a08_##上，越來越多的人認識到，在不同的文化體系背景下生活的東西方
ZW02n0000_p0130a09_##人必須加強相互的交流與理解，必須繼承與發揚人類共同的傳統
ZW02n0000_p0130a10_##文化中一切優秀的成份，以共同創造一個更加美好的的未來。電
ZW02n0000_p0130a11_##腦化大藏經推向信息化高速公路，將對中西文化的對話，體現出中
ZW02n0000_p0130a12_##華民族恢宏的氣魄和博大的胸懷，更積極、更主動地吸收外來文化
ZW02n0000_p0130a13_##的優秀成果，有著很深遠的意義。
ZW02n0000_p0130a14_##<p,0,2>四、推動統一戰線工作。大藏經工程對海外華人世界將會產
ZW02n0000_p0130a15_##生重大影響，可以喚起海內外大多數華人對我們的理解和支持。
ZW02n0000_p0130a16_##這一工程對海峽兩岸的統一有著強大的推動作用，它可以使所有
ZW02n0000_p0130a17_##中國人都能認識到，中華民族的偉大文化是我們共同創造的，也是
ZW02n0000_p0130a18_##我們統一的基礎。目前，我國佛教分三大語系，漢語系、藏語系和
ZW02n0000_p0130a19_##巴利語系，我們可以把藏語系佛教經典和巴利語系佛教的三藏翻
ZW02n0000_p0130a20_##譯過來，補充到漢文大藏經中去。這既生動地反映了各民族文化
ZW02n0000_p0130a21_##的融合的過程，又體現了各民族的大團結。這一宏偉工程所產生
ZW02n0000_p0130a22_##凝聚力和向心力是難以估量的。
ZW02n0000_p0130a23_##<p,0,2>就大藏經工程在海內外進展的情況這一專題，中國社會科學
ZW02n0000_p0130a24_##院世界宗教研究所的研究員楊曾文、李富華、副研究員方廣錩、張
ZW02n0000_p0130a25_##新鷹等作了專題發言，介紹了臺灣、香港、日本、韓國、泰國、斯里蘭
ZW02n0000_p0130a26_##卡、美國等國家和地區近年在漢文大藏經編印與電腦化工程方面
ZW02n0000_p0130a27_##的進展情況。特別是方廣錩先生詳盡地介紹了海外各地在大藏經
ZW02n0000_p0130a28_##電腦化方面的進展與特點，使與會者感到了我們實施大藏經工程
ZW02n0000_p0131a01_##的緊迫感。同時有關專家也分別介紹了國內版《中華大藏經》的經
ZW02n0000_p0131a02_##驗和得失、臺灣《中華大藏經》的始末。中國佛協佛學專家黃炳璋
ZW02n0000_p0131a03_##介紹了《房山石經》的刊印情況，大家一致認為應該充分掌握和吸
ZW02n0000_p0131a04_##取海內外的成功經驗與教訓，搞好我們自己的大藏經的編纂與電
ZW02n0000_p0131a05_##腦化工程。
ZW02n0000_p0131a06_##<p,0,2>就大藏經工程的可行性與操作性這一專題，中國佛教文化研
ZW02n0000_p0131a07_##究所所長吳立民、中國社會科學院研究員杜繼文、副研究員方廣
ZW02n0000_p0131a08_##錩、中國佛教協會副會長周紹良、淨慧法師、北京大學教授樓宇烈、
ZW02n0000_p0131a09_##中央民族大學教授蘇晉仁、中華書局副總經理熊國楨、清華大學教
ZW02n0000_p0131a10_##授葛兆光等作了專題發言，發言中大家就新編大藏經的編纂方案
ZW02n0000_p0131a11_##進行了討論，吳立民、方廣錩先生分別介紹了自己的編纂思想。他
ZW02n0000_p0131a12_##們共同強調了編纂大藏經的三要素：第一，資料的完整性。第二，
ZW02n0000_p0131a13_##編排的科學性。第三，使用的方便性。資料的完整性即資料齊全，
ZW02n0000_p0131a14_##要兼具備查型、義理型、信仰型三種功能形態。特別要把新編入藏
ZW02n0000_p0131a15_##作為重點，對現代資料的入藏要掌握好「度」。編排的科學性即編
ZW02n0000_p0131a16_##排科學，要解決好藏經總結構及某些具體典籍的歸類問題。使用
ZW02n0000_p0131a17_##的方便性包括載體形式、校勘標點、目錄提要索引、實用辭書等四
ZW02n0000_p0131a18_##個方面。吳立民先生還就新編大藏經中定好體例、編好目錄、選好
ZW02n0000_p0131a19_##版本、搞好標點四項基本工作進行了論述。杜繼文先生介紹了呂
ZW02n0000_p0131a20_##澂先生《新編漢文大藏經目錄》的一些情況。
ZW02n0000_p0131a21_##<p,0,2>幾乎所有與會者都認為，要編好大藏經必須具備以下條件：良
ZW02n0000_p0131a22_##好的內部和外部環境，特別是國家的支持；學術界與宗教界的通力
ZW02n0000_p0131a23_##合作；充足的財力；資料保證；計算機技術等。另外大家還就編纂
ZW02n0000_p0131a24_##過程中標點、校勘、校對、編目等具體環節進行了詳盡的討論，提出
ZW02n0000_p0131a25_##為了配合這項工程並有利於培養人才，可以與有關高校聯合開辦
ZW02n0000_p0131a26_##研究生班，與佛學院等單位合作來從事這項工程。
ZW02n0000_p0131a27_##<p,0,2>就大藏經的電腦化技術這一專題，中國綜合開發研究院電腦技術
ZW02n0000_p0131a28_##專家龍隆、王培棣、林滄、中國社會科學院研究員欒貴明等作了專題發
ZW02n0000_p0132a01_##言。他們認為，大藏經的電腦化可以提供一個文獻整理的全新的視
ZW02n0000_p0132a02_##野，這是一個開放的系統，能夠不斷修改、擴充和整理，可以把恆久性
ZW02n0000_p0132a03_##與階段性的工作目標有機地統一起來。在錄入、校對、斷句、出版等工
ZW02n0000_p0132a04_##作中提供了一個廣泛參與的機會和最現代化、最有效的手段與方式。
ZW02n0000_p0132a05_##將古代典籍錄入電子計算機，採用磁盤、光盤等介質加以儲存，可以大
ZW02n0000_p0132a06_##大提高典籍文獻的查詢檢索速度，提高資料使用效率，簡化資料收藏
ZW02n0000_p0132a07_##保管工作。對於中文大藏經這樣的大型典籍，在現代社會，尤其要借
ZW02n0000_p0132a08_##助於電子計算機這一現代化技術手段來整理和存儲。也可以順利地
ZW02n0000_p0132a09_##參與國際交流，製作費用和耗時也能夠大大節省。另外，還就工作中
ZW02n0000_p0132a10_##的具體技術細節進行了討論。
ZW02n0000_p0132a11_##<p,0,2>通過兩天的座談，各位專家一致認為大藏經工程是一項意義深遠
ZW02n0000_p0132a12_##的跨世紀的文化工程，有其必要性和可行性，而且又是一個緊迫和艱
ZW02n0000_p0132a13_##苦的事業。因此，既要抓住良機，努力做好，又要慎重行事。最後大家
ZW02n0000_p0132a14_##達成了共識，這項工程要分三步走。第一步，策動。首先要得到中央
ZW02n0000_p0132a15_##的重視，海內外華人的關注，尤其是全體佛教徒的關注；其次，要仔細
ZW02n0000_p0132a16_##研究，儘快對大藏經工程作出具體的科學的論證。第二步，啟動。如
ZW02n0000_p0132a17_##果各方面條件具備，將由國務院宗教局出面做以下工作：（1）組織專家
ZW02n0000_p0132a18_##學者，形成專門的組織機構；（2）經費主要從幾個方面解決，一是靠各
ZW02n0000_p0132a19_##方面的集資；二是成立相應的基金會；三是同國際慣例接軌，講求經濟
ZW02n0000_p0132a20_##效益，實行自養。（3）具體實施要按兩條腿走路的方針，一方面電腦先
ZW02n0000_p0132a21_##行建數據庫，另一方面請專家、學者搞先期編纂工作，雙方專家的電腦
ZW02n0000_p0132a22_##和佛學知識要互補、兼有。第三步，滾動。我們要考慮遠景規劃，把各
ZW02n0000_p0132a23_##方面的力量進行整合，爭取將他們都集中在共同的目標下。收集國際
ZW02n0000_p0132a24_##上的所有有關資料，海納百川，有容乃大。大藏經工程困難很多，但正
ZW02n0000_p0132a25_##因為如此，纔更有價值。祇要我們團結各方面的力量，宏揚民族精神，
ZW02n0000_p0132a26_##就一定能完成歷史賦予我們的這一跨世紀的偉大文化工程。
